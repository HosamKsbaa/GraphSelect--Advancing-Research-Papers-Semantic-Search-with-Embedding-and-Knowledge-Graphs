"RAGAT: Relation Aware Graph Attention Network for Knowledge Graph Completion","RAGAT outperforms existing models in knowledge graph completion by incorporating relation-specific parameters and message functions, enhancing the expressive capability of message functions.","Xiyang Liu, Huobin Tan, Qinghong Chen, Guangyan Lin",2021,25,"Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is the task of predicting missing links based on known triples for knowledge graphs. Several recent works suggest that Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that exploit graph structures achieve promising performance on KGC. These models learn information called messages from neighboring entities and relations and then aggregate messages to update central entity representations. The drawback of existing GNN based models lies in that they tend to treat relations equally and learn fixed network parameters, overlooking the distinction of each relational information. In this work, we propose a Relation Aware Graph ATtention network (RAGAT) that constructs separate message functions for different relations, which aims at exploiting the heterogeneous characteristics of knowledge graphs. Specifically, we introduce relation specific parameters to augment the expressive capability of message functions, which enables the model to extract relational information in parameter space. To validate the effect of relation aware mechanism, RAGAT is implemented with a variety of relation aware message functions. Experiments show RAGAT outperforms state-of-the-art link prediction baselines on standard FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055529","https://consensus.app/papers/ragat-relation-aware-graph-attention-network-knowledge-liu/be9e9a750d2a556b8da76162008c613d/"
"A Comprehensive Survey on Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction","This survey reviews over 300 methods for automatic knowledge graph construction, focusing on knowledge acquisition, refinement, and evolution, and provides resources for practical knowledge graph systems.","Lingfeng Zhong, Jia Wu, Qian Li, Hao Peng, Xindong Wu",2023,8,"Automatic knowledge graph construction aims at manufacturing structured human knowledge. To this end, much effort has historically been spent extracting informative fact patterns from different data sources. However, more recently, research interest has shifted to acquiring conceptualized structured knowledge beyond informative data. In addition, researchers have also been exploring new ways of handling sophisticated construction tasks in diversified scenarios. Thus, there is a demand for a systematic review of paradigms to organize knowledge structures beyond data-level mentions. To meet this demand, we comprehensively survey more than 300 methods to summarize the latest developments in knowledge graph construction. A knowledge graph is built in three steps: knowledge acquisition, knowledge refinement, and knowledge evolution. The processes of knowledge acquisition are reviewed in detail, including obtaining entities with fine-grained types and their conceptual linkages to knowledge graphs; resolving coreferences; and extracting entity relationships in complex scenarios. The survey covers models for knowledge refinement, including knowledge graph completion, and knowledge fusion. Methods to handle knowledge evolution are also systematically presented, including condition knowledge acquisition, condition knowledge graph completion, and knowledge dynamic. We present the paradigms to compare the distinction among these methods along the axis of the data environment, motivation, and architecture. Additionally, we also provide briefs on accessible resources that can help readers to develop practical knowledge graph systems. The survey concludes with discussions on the challenges and possible directions for future exploration.","systematic review","ACM Computing Surveys","1","10.48550/arXiv.2302.05019","https://consensus.app/papers/comprehensive-survey-automatic-knowledge-graph-zhong/a423407f450e51228681d3b896c3fbc6/"
"RAG: An update to the RNA-As-Graphs resource","The updated RNA-As-Graphs resource enhances the search for novel RNA functionality by classifying existing motifs, suggesting new motifs, and allowing more specific searches for specific topologies.","Joseph A. Izzo, N. Kim, Shereef Elmetwaly, Tamar Schlick",2011,98,"BackgroundIn 2004, we presented a web resource for stimulating the search for novel RNAs, RNA-As-Graphs (RAG), which classified, catalogued, and predicted RNA secondary structure motifs using clustering and build-up approaches. With the increased availability of secondary structures in recent years, we update the RAG resource and provide various improvements for analyzing RNA structures.DescriptionOur RAG update includes a new supervised clustering algorithm that can suggest RNA motifs that may be ""RNA-like"". We use this utility to describe RNA motifs as three classes: existing, RNA-like, and non-RNA-like. This produces 126 tree and 16,658 dual graphs as candidate RNA-like topologies using the supervised clustering algorithm with existing RNAs serving as the training data. A comparison of this clustering approach to an earlier method shows considerable improvements. Additional RAG features include greatly expanded search capabilities, an interface to better utilize the benefits of relational database, and improvements to several of the utilities such as directed/labeled graphs and a subgraph search program.ConclusionsThe RAG updates presented here augment the database's intended function - stimulating the search for novel RNA functionality - by classifying available motifs, suggesting new motifs for design, and allowing for more specific searches for specific topologies. The updated RAG web resource offers users a graph-based tool for exploring available RNA motifs and suggesting new RNAs for design.","","BMC Bioinformatics","1","10.1186/1471-2105-12-219","https://consensus.app/papers/rnaasgraphs-resource-izzo/a38df00d516d51478ae34f7815e5c693/"
"A retrospective of knowledge graphs","Knowledge graphs efficiently integrate information from various data sources, making them an effective and easy-to-use knowledge integration approach.","Jihong Yan, Chengyu Wang, Wenliang Cheng, Ming Gao, Aoying Zhou",2018,112,"Information on the Internet is fragmented and presented in different data sources, which makes automatic knowledge harvesting and understanding formidable for machines, and even for humans. Knowledge graphs have become prevalent in both of industry and academic circles these years, to be one of the most efficient and effective knowledge integration approaches. Techniques for knowledge graph construction can mine information from either structured, semi-structured, or even unstructured data sources, and finally integrate the information into knowledge, represented in a graph. Furthermore, knowledge graph is able to organize information in an easy-to-maintain, easy-to-understand and easy-to-use manner.In this paper, we give a summarization of techniques for constructing knowledge graphs. We review the existing knowledge graph systems developed by both academia and industry. We discuss in detail about the process of building knowledge graphs, and survey state-of-the-art techniques for automatic knowledge graph checking and expansion via logical inferring and reasoning. We also review the issues of graph data management by introducing the knowledge data models and graph databases, especially from a NoSQL point of view. Finally, we overview current knowledge graph systems and discuss the future research directions.","","Frontiers of Computer Science","1","10.1007/s11704-016-5228-9","https://consensus.app/papers/knowledge-graphs-yan/34c0a96a520354e5b249b3e125be041f/"
"Stream2Graph: Dynamic Knowledge Graph for Online Learning Applied in Large-scale Network","Stream2Graph effectively builds and updates knowledge graphs in real-time, enhancing big data learning and knowledge extraction in Graph-based AI applications.","Mariam Barry, A. Bifet, Raja Chiky, Saad El Jaouhari, Jacob Montiel, Aissa El Ouafi, Eric Guerizec",2022,1,"Knowledge Graphs (KG) are valuable information sources that store knowledge in a domain (healthcare, finance, e-commerce, cyber-security.). Most industrial KGs are dynamic by nature as they are updated regularly with streaming data (customer activity, network traffic, application logs, IT process). However, extracting insights from continuously updated data comes with major challenges, particularly in big data settings. In this paper, we address the following challenges: 1) ingesting heterogeneous data, 2) training and deployment of predictive models on continuously evolving data, and 3) implementation of data pipelines for updating and maintaining the KG in production. We cover multiple aspects of this process, from knowledge collection to its operationalization. We propose Stream2Graph, a stream-based system for building and updating the knowledge base dynamically in real time. Then we show how graph features can be used in downstream online machine learning models. The solution speeds up big data stream learning and knowledge extraction to enhance Graph-based AI applications. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our solution for knowledge base construction and improvement of big data learning capabilities. Using data from Stream2Graph resulted in speedups for training and inference time in the range from 547x to 2000x in downstream ML models. Finally, we provide the lessons learned from applying graph-based online learning on large-scale network processing high-velocity streaming data.","","2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020885","https://consensus.app/papers/stream2graph-dynamic-knowledge-graph-online-learning-barry/84de39b3827354c58817a8b3b10d8c98/"
"Zero-shot Slot Filling with DPR and RAG","Our KGI0 system improves Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to become a better slot filler, reaching top-1 position on the KILT leaderboard on both T-REx and zsRE datasets.","Michael R. Glass, Gaetano Rossiello, A. Gliozzo",2021,0,"The ability to automatically extract Knowledge Graphs (KG) from a given collection of documents is a long-standing problem in Artificial Intelligence. One way to assess this capability is through the task of slot filling. Given an entity query in form of [Entity, Slot, ?], a system is asked to `fill' the slot by generating or extracting the missing value from a relevant passage or passages. This capability is crucial to create systems for automatic knowledge base population, which is becoming in ever-increasing demand, especially in enterprise applications. Recently, there has been a promising direction in evaluating language models in the same way we would evaluate knowledge bases, and the task of slot filling is the most suitable to this intent. The recent advancements in the field try to solve this task in an end-to-end fashion using retrieval-based language models. Models like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) show surprisingly good performance without involving complex information extraction pipelines. However, the results achieved by these models on the two slot filling tasks in the KILT benchmark are still not at the level required by real-world information extraction systems. In this paper, we describe several strategies we adopted to improve the retriever and the generator of RAG in order to make it a better slot filler. Our KGI0 system (available at https://github.com/IBM/retrieve-write-slot-filling) reached the top-1 position on the KILT leaderboard on both T-REx and zsRE dataset with a large margin.","","ArXiv","","","https://consensus.app/papers/zeroshot-slot-filling-glass/0db579ba817e56048025c2b34c626513/"
"Updating Embeddings for Dynamic Knowledge Graphs","Continuing training of old embeddings, optimizing for added and removed parts, can maintain embeddings for dynamic Knowledge Graphs, resulting in better link prediction performance than full retraining.","Christopher Wewer, F. Lemmerich, Michael Cochez",2021,2,"Data in Knowledge Graphs often represents part of the current state of the real world. Thus, to stay up-to-date the graph data needs to be updated frequently. To utilize information from Knowledge Graphs, many state-of-the-art machine learning approaches use embedding techniques. These techniques typically compute an embedding, i.e., vector representations of the nodes as input for the main machine learning algorithm. If a graph update occurs later on — specifically when nodes are added or removed — the training has to be done all over again. This is undesirable, because of the time it takes and also because downstream models which were trained with these embeddings have to be retrained if they change significantly. In this paper, we investigate embedding updates that do not require full retraining and evaluate them in combination with various embedding models on real dynamic Knowledge Graphs covering multiple use cases. We study approaches that place newly appearing nodes optimally according to local information, but notice that this does not work well. However, we find that if we continue the training of the old embedding, interleaved with epochs during which we only optimize for the added and removed parts, we obtain good results in terms of typical metrics used in link prediction. This performance is obtained much faster than with a complete retraining and hence makes it possible to maintain embeddings for dynamic Knowledge Graphs.","","ArXiv","","","https://consensus.app/papers/updating-embeddings-dynamic-knowledge-graphs-wewer/53871c0cf27a5374a4dad9bcf2e7a04c/"
"Constructing Knowledge Graphs for Online Collaborative Programming","Our system automatically constructs knowledge graphs for online collaborative programming, with high accuracy in entity recognition and relation extraction, aiding personalized learning services.","Yuanyi Zhen, Lanqin Zheng, Penghe Chen",2021,3,"This study aimed to automatically construct knowledge graphs for online collaborative programming. We proposed several models and developed a system to construct knowledge graphs based on online discussion texts and the target knowledge graph for the C programming language. Our system included two main modules, namely, entity recognition and relation extraction. We proposed an innovative approach for recognizing knowledge entities, which included sequence tagging, text classification, and keyword matching. The extraction of relationships among knowledge entities was performed through queries of the target knowledge graph. The six kinds of knowledge graphs could be automatically generated through our method, including the activated and unactivated knowledge graphs of each student, each group, and each class. The accuracy of entity recognition reached 87.27%. The accuracies of relation extraction for students, groups, and the class reached 89.7%, 90.4%, and 90.2%, respectively. This study is very promising and significant for both teachers and practitioners to provide interventions and personalized learning services based on the constructed knowledge graphs.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106324","https://consensus.app/papers/constructing-knowledge-graphs-online-collaborative-zhen/7ccbb121dd025493a6e0a22186917255/"
"Building event-centric knowledge graphs from news","Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs (ECKGs) can enhance user understanding of news domains, facilitate story reconstruction, and enable exploratory investigation of hidden news facts.","M. Rospocher, M. Erp, P. Vossen, Antske Fokkens, Itziar Aldabe, German Rigau, Aitor Soroa Etxabe, T. Ploeger, Tessel Bogaard",2016,170,"Knowledge graphs have gained increasing popularity in the past couple of years, thanks to their adoption in everyday search engines. Typically, they consist of fairly static and encyclopedic facts about persons and organizations-e.g.?a celebrity's birth date, occupation and family members-obtained from large repositories such as Freebase or Wikipedia.In this paper, we present a method and tools to automatically build knowledge graphs from news articles. As news articles describe changes in the world through the events they report, we present an approach to create Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs (ECKGs) using state-of-the-art natural language processing and semantic web techniques. Such ECKGs capture long-term developments and histories on hundreds of thousands of entities and are complementary to the static encyclopedic information in traditional knowledge graphs.We describe our event-centric representation schema, the challenges in extracting event information from news, our open source pipeline, and the knowledge graphs we have extracted from four different news corpora: general news (Wikinews), the FIFA world cup, the Global Automotive Industry, and Airbus A380 airplanes. Furthermore, we present an assessment on the accuracy of the pipeline in extracting the triples of the knowledge graphs. Moreover, through an event-centered browser and visualization tool we show how approaching information from news in an event-centric manner can increase the user's understanding of the domain, facilitates the reconstruction of news story lines, and enable to perform exploratory investigation of news hidden facts.","","J.

"Learning to Update Knowledge Graphs by Reading News","GUpdater, a novel neural network method, effectively updates knowledge graphs by reading news, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information in knowledge graphs.","Jizhi Tang, Yansong Feng, Dongyan Zhao",2019,20,"News streams contain rich up-to-date information which can be used to update knowledge graphs (KGs). Most current text-based KG updating methods rely on elaborately designed information extraction (IE) systems and carefully crafted rules, which are often domain-specific and hard to maintain. Besides, such methods often hardly pay enough attention to the implicit information that lies underneath texts. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network method, GUpdater, to tackle these problems. GUpdater is built upon graph neural networks (GNNs) with a text-based attention mechanism to guide the updating message passing through the KG structures. Experiments on a real-world KG updating dataset show that our model can effectively broadcast the news information to the KG structures and perform necessary link-adding or link-deleting operations to ensure the KG up-to-date according to news snippets.","","","","10.18653/v1/D19-1265","https://consensus.app/papers/learning-update-knowledge-graphs-reading-news-tang/90a84a7ee442505dbae18e793adeb8d1/"
