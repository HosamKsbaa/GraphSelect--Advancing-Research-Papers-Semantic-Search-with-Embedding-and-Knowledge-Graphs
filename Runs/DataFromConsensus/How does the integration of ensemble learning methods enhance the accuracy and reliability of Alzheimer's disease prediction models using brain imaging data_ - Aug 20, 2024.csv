"Multi-model and multi-slice ensemble learning architecture based on 2D convolutional neural networks for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis","The proposed ensemble learning architecture based on 2D CNNs provides an effective, accurate, and automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, even with limited neuroimaging data.","Wenjie Kang, Lan Lin, Baiwen Zhang, Xiaoqi Shen, Shuicai Wu",2021,52,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease without effective medications or supplemental treatments. Thus, predicting AD progression is crucial for clinical practice and medical research. Due to limited neuroimaging data, two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D CNNs) have been commonly adopted to differentiate among cognitively normal subjects (CN), people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients. Therefore, this paper proposes an ensemble learning (EL) architecture based on 2D CNNs, using a multi-model and multi-slice ensemble. First, the top 11 coronal slices of grey matter density maps for AD versus CN classifications were selected. Second, the discriminator of a generative adversarial network, VGG16, and ResNet50 were trained with the selected slices, and the majority voting scheme was used to merge the multi-slice decisions of each model. Afterwards, those three classifiers were used to construct an ensemble model. Multi-slice ensemble learning was designed to obtain spatial features, while multi-model integration reduced the prediction error rate. Finally, transfer learning was used in domain adaptation to refine those CNNs, moving them from working solely with AD versus CN classifications to being applicable to other tasks. This ensemble approach achieved accuracy values of 90.36%, 77.19%, and 72.36% when classifying AD versus CN, AD versus MCI, and MCI versus CN, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art 2D studies, the proposed approach provides an effective, accurate, automatic diagnosis along the AD continuum. This technique may enhance AD diagnostics when the sample size is limited.","","Computers in biology and medicine","1","10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104678","https://consensus.app/papers/multimodel-multislice-learning-architecture-based-kang/690b29bb1e045a308316364de7ba0544/"
"A Comprehensive Machine-Learning Model Applied to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to Predict Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Older Subjects","A machine learning model using ensemble modeling, coupled with selective features, can accurately predict Alzheimer's disease development in older subjects.","G. Battineni, N. Chintalapudi, F. Amenta, E. Traini",2020,41,"Increasing evidence suggests the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an important technique for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and for predicting the onset of this neurodegenerative disorder. In this study, we present a sophisticated machine learning (ML) model of great accuracy to diagnose the early stages of AD. A total of 373 MRI tests belonging to 150 subjects (age ≥ 60) were examined and analyzed in parallel with fourteen distinct features related to standard AD diagnosis. Four ML models, such as naive Bayes (NB), artificial neural networks (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support-vector machines (SVM), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve metric were used to validate the model performance. Each model evaluation was done in three independent experiments. In the first experiment, a manual feature selection was used for model training, and ANN generated the highest accuracy in terms of ROC (0.812). In the second experiment, automatic feature selection was conducted by wrapping methods, and the NB achieved the highest ROC of 0.942. The last experiment consisted of an ensemble or hybrid modeling developed to combine the four models. This approach resulted in an improved accuracy ROC of 0.991. We conclude that the involvement of ensemble modeling, coupled with selective features, can predict with better accuracy the development of AD at an early stage.","","Journal of Clinical Medicine","1","10.3390/jcm9072146","https://consensus.app/papers/comprehensive-machinelearning-model-applied-magnetic-battineni/2511c2660539592bb0db26d719314c53/"
"Voting Ensemble Approach for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Disease Classification","The ensemble voting method, combining multiple individual classifier predictions, improves Alzheimer's disease classification accuracy and reliability.","Subhajit Chatterjee, Y. Byun",2022,5,"Alzheimer’s disease is dementia that impairs one’s thinking, behavior, and memory. It starts as a moderate condition affecting areas of the brain that make it challenging to retain recently learned information, causes mood swings, and causes confusion regarding occasions, times, and locations. The most prevalent type of dementia, called Alzheimer’s disease (AD), causes memory-related problems in patients. A precise medical diagnosis that correctly classifies AD patients results in better treatment. Currently, the most commonly used classification techniques extract features from longitudinal MRI data before creating a single classifier that performs classification. However, it is difficult to train a reliable classifier to achieve acceptable classification performance due to limited sample size and noise in longitudinal MRI data. Instead of creating a single classifier, we propose an ensemble voting method that generates multiple individual classifier predictions and then combines them to develop a more accurate and reliable classifier. The ensemble voting classifier model performs better in the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset for older adults than existing methods in important assessment criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. For the binary classification of with dementia and no dementia, an accuracy of 96.4% and an AUC of 97.2% is attained.","","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","1","10.3390/s22197661","https://consensus.app/papers/voting-approach-enhancing-alzheimer-disease-chatterjee/c4778d8884cf5c56a0ef17783e557f5a/"
"Multimodal deep learning models for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease stage","Deep learning models combining imaging, genetic, and clinical data improve early detection of Alzheimer's disease stages.","Janani Venugopalan, L. Tong, H. Hassanzadeh, May D. Wang",2021,231,"Most current Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive disorders (MCI) studies use single data modality to make predictions such as AD stages. The fusion of multiple data modalities can provide a holistic view of AD staging analysis. Thus, we use deep learning (DL) to integrally analyze imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), and clinical test data to classify patients into AD, MCI, and controls (CN). We use stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis. Using Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, we demonstrate that deep models outperform shallow models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating multi-modality data outperforms single modality models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and meanF1 scores.

"Deep ensemble learning of sparse regression models for brain disease diagnosis","The Deep Ensemble Sparse Regression Network effectively combines sparse regression models and deep learning for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment diagnosis and prognosis, achieving the highest diagnostic accuracies in three classification tasks.","Heung-Il Suk, Seong-Whan Lee, D. Shen",2017,225,"HighlightsA novel framework that combines the two conceptually different methods of sparse regression and deep learning for AD/MCI diagnosis.Use of the outputs from sparse regression models with different values of a regularization control parameter as target‐level representations.Rigorous experiments with MR images of 805 subjects in the ADNI cohort. Graphical abstract Figure. No Caption available. Abstract Recent studies on brain imaging analysis witnessed the core roles of machine learning techniques in computer‐assisted intervention for brain disease diagnosis. Of various machine‐learning techniques, sparse regression models have proved their effectiveness in handling high‐dimensional data but with a small number of training samples, especially in medical problems. In the meantime, deep learning methods have been making great successes by outperforming the state‐of‐the‐art performances in various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the two conceptually different methods of sparse regression and deep learning for Alzheimer’s disease/mild cognitive impairment diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, we first train multiple sparse regression models, each of which is trained with different values of a regularization control parameter. Thus, our multiple sparse regression models potentially select different feature subsets from the original feature set; thereby they have different powers to predict the response values, i.e., clinical label and clinical scores in our work. By regarding the response values from our sparse regression models as target‐level representations, we then build a deep convolutional neural network for clinical decision making, which thus we call ‘Deep Ensemble Sparse Regression Network.’ To our best knowledge, this is the first work that combines sparse regression models with deep neural network. In our experiments with the ADNI cohort, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving the highest diagnostic accuracies in three classification tasks. We also rigorously analyzed our results and compared with the previous studies on the ADNI cohort in the literature.","","Medical Image Analysis","1","10.1016/j.media.2017.01.008","https://consensus.app/papers/deep-learning-regression-models-brain-disease-diagnosis-suk/3eb865d1cde057dd85f81c2109ab0194/"
"Ensemble of convolutional neural networks and multilayer perceptron for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.","The proposed ensemble framework accurately diagnoses Alzheimer's disease and predicts MCI conversion using structural magnetic resonance imaging, offering potential clinical practice applications.","Minglei Li, Yuchen Jiang, Xiang Li, Shen Yin, Hao Luo",2022,0,"BACKGROUND
Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) can provide morphological information about the structure and function of the brain in the same scanning process. It has been widely used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).


PURPOSE
To capture the anatomical changes in the brain caused by AD/MCI, deep learning-based MRI image analysis methods have been proposed in recent years. However, it is observed that the performance of most existing methods is limited as they only construct a single type of deep network and ignore the significance of other clinical information.


METHODS
To make up for these defects, an ensemble framework that incorporates three types of dedicatedly-designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network is proposed, where three CNNs with entropy-based multi-instance learning pooling layers have more reliable feature selection abilities. The dedicatedly-designed base classifiers can make use of the heterogeneous data, and empower the framework with enhanced diversity and robustness. In particular, to consider the interactions among the base classifiers, a novel multi-head self-attention voting scheme is designed. Moreover, considering the chance that MCI can be transformed to AD, the proposed framework is designed to diagnose AD and predict MCI conversion simultaneously, with the aid of the transfer learning technique.


RESULTS
For performance evaluation and comparison, extensive experiments are conducted on the public dataset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The results show that the proposed ensemble framework provides superior performance under most of the evaluation metrics. Especially, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy (98.61% for the AD diagnosis task, and 84.49% for the MCI conversion prediction task).


CONCLUSIONS
These promising results demonstrate the proposed ensemble framework can accurately diagnose AD patients and predict the conversion of MCI patients, which has the potential of clinical practice for diagnosing AD and MCI.

"An Efficient Ensemble Approach for Alzheimer’s Disease Detection Using an Adaptive Synthetic Technique and Deep Learning","The ensemble of EfficientNet-B2 and VGG-16 effectively detects Alzheimer's disease early stage with high accuracy, achieving 97.35% accuracy and 99.64% AUC for multiclass datasets and 97.09% accuracy and 99.59% AUC for binary-class datasets.","Muhammad Mujahid, A. Rehman, Teg Alam, Faten S. Alamri, Suliman Mohamed Fati, T. Saba",2023,4,"Alzheimer’s disease is an incurable neurological disorder that leads to a gradual decline in cognitive abilities, but early detection can significantly mitigate symptoms. The automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is more important due to the shortage of expert medical staff, because it reduces the burden on medical staff and enhances the results of diagnosis. A detailed analysis of specific brain disorder tissues is required to accurately diagnose the disease via segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Several studies have used the traditional machine-learning approaches to diagnose the disease from MRI, but manual extracted features are more complex, time-consuming, and require a huge amount of involvement from expert medical staff. The traditional approach does not provide an accurate diagnosis. Deep learning has automatic extraction features and optimizes the training process. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Alzheimer’s disease dataset consists of four classes: mild demented (896 images), moderate demented (64 images), non-demented (3200 images), and very mild demented (2240 images). The dataset is highly imbalanced. Therefore, we used the adaptive synthetic oversampling technique to address this issue. After applying this technique, the dataset was balanced. The ensemble of VGG16 and EfficientNet was used to detect Alzheimer’s disease on both imbalanced and balanced datasets to validate the performance of the models. The proposed method combined the predictions of multiple models to make an ensemble model that learned complex and nuanced patterns from the data. The input and output of both models were concatenated to make an ensemble model and then added to other layers to make a more robust model. In this study, we proposed an ensemble of EfficientNet-B2 and VGG-16 to diagnose the disease at an early stage with the highest accuracy. Experiments were performed on two publicly available datasets. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved 97.35% accuracy and 99.64% AUC for multiclass datasets and 97.09% accuracy and 99.59% AUC for binary-class datasets. We evaluated that the proposed method was extremely efficient and provided superior performance on both datasets as compared to previous methods.","","Diagnostics","2","10.3390/diagnostics13152489","https://consensus.app/papers/efficient-ensemble-approach-alzheimer-disease-detection-mujahid/a4416b0b07485d2faf1b76269816bad4/"
"Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Novel Approach Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning","The CNN-EL approach effectively identifies Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment using MRI, with potential for early detection and better understanding of brain changes in Alzheimer's patients.","Dan Pan, An Zeng, L. Jia, Yin Huang, T. Frizzell, Xiaowei Song",2020,143,"Early detection is critical for effective management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common practice. Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject’s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.","","Frontiers in Neuroscience","2","10.3389/fnins.2020.00259","https://consensus.app/papers/detection-alzheimer-disease-using-magnetic-resonance-pan/43d1b82249ec5c81b845d5b299be2311/"
