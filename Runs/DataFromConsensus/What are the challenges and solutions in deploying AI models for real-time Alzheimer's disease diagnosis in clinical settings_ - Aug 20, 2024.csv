"A multilayer multimodal detection and prediction model based on explainable artificial intelligence for Alzheimer’s disease","This two-layer model accurately diagnoses Alzheimer's disease and detects progression, providing trustworthy, accountable, and medically applicable results for physicians.","Shaker El-Sappagh, J. M. Alonso, S. Islam, Ahmad M Sultan, K. Kwak",2021,103,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. Its diagnosis and progression detection have been intensively studied. Nevertheless, research studies often have little effect on clinical practice mainly due to the following reasons: (1) Most studies depend mainly on a single modality, especially neuroimaging; (2) diagnosis and progression detection are usually studied separately as two independent problems; and (3) current studies concentrate mainly on optimizing the performance of complex machine learning models, while disregarding their explainability. As a result, physicians struggle to interpret these models, and feel it is hard to trust them. In this paper, we carefully develop an accurate and interpretable AD diagnosis and progression detection model. This model provides physicians with accurate decisions along with a set of explanations for every decision. Specifically, the model integrates 11 modalities of 1048 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) real-world dataset: 294 cognitively normal, 254 stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 232 progressive MCI, and 268 AD. It is actually a two-layer model with random forest (RF) as classifier algorithm. In the first layer, the model carries out a multi-class classification for the early diagnosis of AD patients. In the second layer, the model applies binary classification to detect possible MCI-to-AD progression within three years from a baseline diagnosis. The performance of the model is optimized with key markers selected from a large set of biological and clinical measures. Regarding explainability, we provide, for each layer, global and instance-based explanations of the RF classifier by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature attribution framework. In addition, we implement 22 explainers based on decision trees and fuzzy rule-based systems to provide complementary justifications for every RF decision in each layer. Furthermore, these explanations are represented in natural language form to help physicians understand the predictions. The designed model achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 93.95% and an F1-score of 93.94% in the first layer, while it achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 87.08% and an F1-Score of 87.09% in the second layer. The resulting system is not only accurate, but also trustworthy, accountable, and medically applicable, thanks to the provided explanations which are broadly consistent with each other and with the AD medical literature. The proposed system can help to enhance the clinical understanding of AD diagnosis and progression processes by providing detailed insights into the effect of different modalities on the disease risk.","","Scientific Reports","1","10.1038/s41598-021-82098-3","https://consensus.app/papers/multilayer-detection-prediction-model-based-elsappagh/3b4531fda35f55cdab0bd31dc0a35317/"
"A whole-process interpretable and multi-modal deep reinforcement learning for diagnosis and analysis of Alzheimer’s disease","This study developed an interpretable multimodal deep reinforcement learning model that accurately diagnoses Alzheimer's disease and analyzes potential biomarkers, improving clinical feasibility and interpretability.","Quan Zhang, Q. Du, Guohua Liu",2021,18,"Objective. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a common disease of the elderly with unknown etiology, has been adversely affecting many people, especially with the aging of the population and the younger trend of this disease. Current artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on individual information or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can solve the problem of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, but still face the challenges of interpretability and clinical feasibility. In this study, we propose an interpretable multimodal deep reinforcement learning model for inferring pathological features and the diagnosis of AD. Approach. First, for better clinical feasibility, the compressed-sensing MRI image is reconstructed using an interpretable deep reinforcement learning model. Then, the reconstructed MRI is input into the full convolution neural network to generate a pixel-level disease probability risk map (DPM) of the whole brain for AD. The DPM of important brain regions and individual information are then input into the attention-based fully deep neural network to obtain the diagnosis results and analyze the biomarkers. We used 1349 multi-center samples to construct and test the model. Main results. Finally, the model obtained 99.6% ± 0.2%, 97.9% ± 0.2%, and 96.1% ± 0.3% area under curve in ADNI, AIBL and NACC, respectively. The model also provides an effective analysis of multimodal pathology, predicts the imaging biomarkers in MRI and the weight of each individual item of information. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning model was designed, which can not only accurately diagnose AD, but analyze potential biomarkers. Significance. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning model was designed. The model builds a bridge between clinical practice and AI diagnosis and provides a viewpoint for the interpretability of AI technology.","","Journal of Neural Engineering","1","10.1088/1741-2552/ac37cc","https://consensus.app/papers/wholeprocess-reinforcement-learning-diagnosis-analysis-zhang/b711e57bb308590ab327d390d33b9e1c/"
"Artificial Intelligence for Alzheimer’s Disease: Promise or Challenge?","AI has the potential to improve Alzheimer's disease research by analyzing large and complex data, potentially leading to better diagnosis, risk prediction, and personalized therapies.","Carlo Fabrizio, Andrea Termine, C. Caltagirone, G. Sancesario",2021,33,"Decades of experimental and clinical research have contributed to unraveling many mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the puzzle is still incomplete. Although we can suppose that there is no complete set of puzzle pieces, the recent growth of open data-sharing initiatives collecting lifestyle, clinical, and biological data from AD patients has provided a potentially unlimited amount of information about the disease, far exceeding the human ability to make sense of it. Moreover, integrating Big Data from multi-omics studies provides the potential to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of the entire biological continuum of AD. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a wide variety of methods to analyze large and complex data in order to improve knowledge in the AD field. In this review, we focus on recent findings and future challenges for AI in AD research. In particular, we discuss the use of Computer-Aided Diagnosis tools for AD diagnosis and the use of AI to potentially support clinical practices for the prediction of individual risk of AD conversion as well as patient stratification in order to finally develop effective and personalized therapies.","","Diagnostics","2","10.3390/diagnostics11081473","https://consensus.app/papers/intelligence-alzheimer-disease-promise-challenge-fabrizio/60c5850c662556e4be3608fab4b9d52a/"
"Potential Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Clinical Trials for Alzheimer’s Disease","AI has the potential to address challenges in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials by predicting biomarkers, facilitating eligibility assessment, and stratifying subjects into rapid and slow progressors.","Youngho Seo, Hyemin Jang, Hyejoo Lee",2022,6,"Clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) face multiple challenges, such as the high screen failure rate and the even allocation of heterogeneous participants.

"Differences in cohort study data affect external validation of artificial intelligence models for predictive diagnostics of dementia - lessons for translation into clinical practice","This study successfully validated an AI model for personalized dementia risk prediction, despite differences in cohort study data, proving that reliable models for personalized predictive diagnostics are feasible.","C. Birkenbihl, Mohammad Asif Emon, H. Vrooman, S. Westwood, S. Lovestone, M. Hofmann-Apitius, H. Fröhlich",2020,31,"Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches pose a great opportunity for individualized, pre-symptomatic disease diagnosis which plays a key role in the context of personalized, predictive, and finally preventive medicine (PPPM). However, to translate PPPM into clinical practice, it is of utmost importance that AI-based models are carefully validated. The validation process comprises several steps, one of which is testing the model on patient-level data from an independent clinical cohort study. However, recruitment criteria can bias statistical analysis of cohort study data and impede model application beyond the training data. To evaluate whether and how data from independent clinical cohort studies differ from each other, this study systematically compares the datasets collected from two major dementia cohorts, namely, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and AddNeuroMed. The presented comparison was conducted on individual feature level and revealed significant differences among both cohorts. Such systematic deviations can potentially hamper the generalizability of results which were based on a single cohort dataset. Despite identified differences, validation of a previously published, ADNI trained model for prediction of personalized dementia risk scores on 244 AddNeuroMed subjects was successful: External validation resulted in a high prediction performance of above 80% area under receiver operator characteristic curve up to 6 years before dementia diagnosis. Propensity score matching identified a subset of patients from AddNeuroMed, which showed significantly smaller demographic differences to ADNI. For these patients, an even higher prediction performance was achieved, which demonstrates the influence systematic differences between cohorts can have on validation results. In conclusion, this study exposes challenges in external validation of AI models on cohort study data and is one of the rare cases in the neurology field in which such external validation was performed. The presented model represents a proof of concept that reliable models for personalized predictive diagnostics are feasible, which, in turn, could lead to adequate disease prevention and hereby enable the PPPM paradigm in the dementia field.","non-rct observational study","The EPMA Journal","1","10.1007/s13167-020-00216-z","https://consensus.app/papers/differences-cohort-study-data-affect-validation-birkenbihl/fbd33c26696a5dbd8918823ad442d2e6/"
"Challenges of Integrative Disease Modeling in Alzheimer's Disease","Integrative Alzheimer's disease modeling has shown promise, but challenges in data missingness, censoring, and model reproducibility require further research to address.","Sepehr Golriz Khatami, C. Robinson, C. Birkenbihl, D. Domingo-Fernándéz, Charles Tapley Hoyt, M. Hofmann-Apitius",2020,14,"Dementia-related diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have a tremendous social and economic cost. A deeper understanding of its underlying pathophysiologies may provide an opportunity for earlier detection and therapeutic intervention. Previous approaches for characterizing AD were targeted at single aspects of the disease. Yet, due to the complex nature of AD, the success of these approaches was limited. However, in recent years, advancements in integrative disease modeling, built on a wide range of AD biomarkers, have taken a global view on the disease, facilitating more comprehensive analysis and interpretation. Integrative AD models can be sorted in two primary types, namely hypothetical models and data-driven models. The latter group split into two subgroups: (i) Models that use traditional statistical methods such as linear models, (ii) Models that take advantage of more advanced artificial intelligence approaches such as machine learning. While many integrative AD models have been published over the last decade, their impact on clinical practice is limited. There exist major challenges in the course of integrative AD modeling, namely data missingness and censoring, imprecise human-involved priori knowledge, model reproducibility, dataset interoperability, dataset integration, and model interpretability. In this review, we highlight recent advancements and future possibilities of integrative modeling in the field of AD research, showcase and discuss the limitations and challenges involved, and finally, propose avenues to address several of these challenges.","","Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences","1","10.3389/fmolb.2019.00158","https://consensus.app/papers/challenges-integrative-disease-modeling-alzheimers-khatami/c5b55bf94b0b508a909d5227d08964c5/"
"Use of artificial intelligence in Alzheimer’s disease detection","AI techniques are effective in Alzheimer's disease detection, aiding in computer-aided diagnosis and identifying variations in brain images for early diagnosis.","A. Subasi",2020,12,"Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent dementia types affecting the elderly population. On-time detection of the AD is valuable to find new approaches for the AD treatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an effective technique for AD detection as these methods are employed as a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system in clinical practices and play a crucial role in identifying variations in the brain images to detect AD. This chapter reviews and summarizes the recent investigations, advances and some related challenges in AI techniques employed for medical image processing and image analysis in AD detection. Several studies have discovered and employed different techniques, including AI techniques for CAD of AD detection. The main concentration lies in getting a reliable, but simple and fast model for automatic AD detection. The approaches to identify AD are based on the application of AI techniques. In this chapter, the concentration will be on AI techniques for AD detection from brain images.

"HTLML: Hybrid AI Based Model for Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease","The HTLML model, combining transfer learning and permutation-based machine learning, effectively detects Alzheimer's disease in MRI images, outperforming current state-of-the-art models.","Sarang Sharma, Sheifali Gupta, Deepali Gupta, Ayman Altameem, Abdul Khader Jilani Saudagar, R. C. Poonia, Soumyabrata Nayak",2022,10,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a degenerative condition of the brain that affects the memory and reasoning abilities of patients. Memory is steadily wiped out by this condition, which gradually affects the brain’s ability to think, recall, and form intentions. In order to properly identify this disease, a variety of manual imaging modalities including CT, MRI, PET, etc. are being used. These methods, however, are time-consuming and troublesome in the context of early diagnostics. This is why deep learning models have been devised that are less time-intensive, require less high-tech hardware or human interaction, continue to improve in performance, and are useful for the prediction of AD, which can also be verified by experimental results obtained by doctors in medical institutions or health care facilities. In this paper, we propose a hybrid-based AI-based model that includes the combination of both transfer learning (TL) and permutation-based machine learning (ML) voting classifier in terms of two basic phases. In the first phase of implementation, it comprises two TL-based models: namely, DenseNet-121 and Densenet-201 for features extraction, whereas in the second phase of implementation, it carries out three different ML classifiers like SVM, Naïve base and XGBoost for classification purposes. The final classifier outcomes are evaluated by means of permutations of the voting mechanism. The proposed model achieved accuracy of 91.75%, specificity of 96.5%, and an F1-score of 90.25. The dataset used for training was obtained from Kaggle and contains 6200 photos, including 896 images classified as mildly demented, 64 images classified as moderately demented, 3200 images classified as non-demented, and 1966 images classified as extremely mildly demented. The results show that the suggested model outperforms current state-of-the-art models. These models could be used to generate therapeutically viable methods for detecting AD in MRI images based on these results for clinical prospective.","","Diagnostics","2","10.3390/diagnostics12081833","https://consensus.app/papers/htlml-hybrid-based-model-detection-alzheimer-disease-sharma/eaa5ea4ad37a569d9f8632b2a2560c94/"

We use stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis.

"Detecting Alzheimer's Disease on Small Dataset: A Knowledge Transfer Perspective","The proposed knowledge transfer method improves Alzheimer's disease detection accuracy by 20% on small datasets, addressing the challenge of limited sample size in computer-aided diagnosis.","Wei Li, Yi Zhao, Xi Chen, Yang Xiao, Yuanyuan Qin",2019,47,"Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is an attractive topic in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Many algorithms are based on a relatively large training dataset. However, small hospitals are usually unable to collect sufficient training samples for robust classification. Although data sharing is expanding in scientific research, it is unclear whether a model based on one dataset is well suited for other data sources. Using a small dataset from a local hospital and a large shared dataset from the AD neuroimaging initiative, we conducted a heterogeneity analysis and found that different functional magnetic resonance imaging data sources show different sample distributions in feature space. In addition, we proposed an effective knowledge transfer method to diminish the disparity among different datasets and improve the classification accuracy on datasets with insufficient training samples. The accuracy increased by approximately 20% compared with that of a model based only on the original small dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach is a novel and effective method for CAD in hospitals with only small training datasets. It solved the challenge of limited sample size in detection of AD, which is a common issue but lack of adequate attention.
