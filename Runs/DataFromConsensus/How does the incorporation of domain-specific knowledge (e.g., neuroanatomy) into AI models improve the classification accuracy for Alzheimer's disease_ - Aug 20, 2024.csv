"Deep Learning in Alzheimer's Disease: Diagnostic Classification and Prognostic Prediction Using Neuroimaging Data","Deep learning approaches show promise for diagnostic classification of Alzheimer's disease using multimodal neuroimaging data, with the best performance achieved when combining multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers.","T. Jo, K. Nho, A. Saykin",2019,352,"Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as—omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.","systematic review","Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience","1","10.3389/fnagi.2019.00220","https://consensus.app/papers/deep-learning-alzheimers-disease-diagnostic-jo/c09b595ff18b50feadfdb073214e1779/"
"Domain adaptation for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics","This study demonstrates high classification accuracy in Alzheimer's disease diagnostics using MRI scans, and demonstrates the importance of domain adaptation with instance weighting for successful clinical deployment.","C. Wachinger, M. Reuter",2016,94,"With the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, research focuses on the early computer-aided diagnosis of dementia with the goal to understand the disease process, determine risk and preserving factors, and explore preventive therapies. By now, large amounts of data from multi-site studies have been made available for developing, training, and evaluating automated classifiers. Yet, their translation to the clinic remains challenging, in part due to their limited generalizability across different datasets. In this work, we describe a compact classification approach that mitigates overfitting by regularizing the multinomial regression with the mixed ℓ1/ℓ2 norm. We combine volume, thickness, and anatomical shape features from MRI scans to characterize neuroanatomy for the three-class classification of Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. We demonstrate high classification accuracy via independent evaluation within the scope of the CADDementia challenge. We, furthermore, demonstrate that variations between source and target datasets can substantially influence classification accuracy. The main contribution of this work addresses this problem by proposing an approach for supervised domain adaptation based on instance weighting. Integration of this method into our classifier allows us to assess different strategies for domain adaptation. Our results demonstrate (i) that training on only the target training set yields better results than the naïve combination (union) of source and target training sets, and (ii) that domain adaptation with instance weighting yields the best classification results, especially if only a small training component of the target dataset is available. These insights imply that successful deployment of systems for computer-aided diagnostics to the clinic depends not only on accurate classifiers that avoid overfitting, but also on a dedicated domain adaptation strategy.","","NeuroImage","1","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.05.053","https://consensus.app/papers/domain-adaptation-alzheimers-disease-diagnostics-wachinger/b21a70b86cd257cf81e0b6eaba603c22/"
"Exploiting Discriminative Regions of Brain Slices Based on 2D CNNs for Alzheimer’s Disease Classification","The proposed models, using SBPCNNs, SACNNs, and MSCNNs, effectively classify Alzheimer's disease and provide clearer understanding for specialists.","Fujia Ren, Chenhui Yang, Qi Qiu, Nianyin Zeng, Chunting Cai, Chaoqun Hou, Q. Zou",2019,32,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based classifiers improve the accuracy of diagnosis and prediction for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, exploiting specific brain regions with the AD is essential to understand pathological alteration in the AD and monitor its progression. This paper aims to construct novel AD classification models which have a good performance and interpretation on AD diagnosis. We propose the three classifiers including a simple broaden plain CNNs (SBPCNNs), a major slice-assemble CNNs (SACNNs) and a multi-slice CNNs (MSCNNs), which record the slice positions but have fewer parameters. Specifically, we integrate the ranking and the random forest methods to find the discriminative region that is consistent with domain knowledge about the AD. The results of the visualization explanation of pixel and slice level deliver a clearer understanding of the AD to specialists. The experimental results indicate that the proposed models are meaningful for AD classification.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920241","https://consensus.app/papers/exploiting-discriminative-regions-brain-slices-based-ren/46c47baa14f054f684ef4e927b435d9f/"
"Ensemble Model for Diagnostic Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Based on Brain Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging","The proposed ensemble-based learning approach (XGB + DT + SVM) outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in Alzheimer's disease classification, with an efficiency of 95.75% after optimizing parameters.","Yusera Farooq Khan, B. Kaushik, C. L. Chowdhary, Gautam Srivastava",2022,10,"Alzheimer’s is one of the fast-growing diseases among people worldwide leading to brain atrophy. Neuroimaging reveals extensive information about the brain’s anatomy and enables the identification of diagnostic features. Artificial intelligence (AI) in neuroimaging has the potential to significantly enhance the treatment process for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The objective of this study is two-fold: (1) to compare existing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of AD. (2) To propose an effective ensemble-based model for the same and to perform its comparative analysis. In this study, data from the Alzheimer’s Diseases Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), an online repository, is utilized for experimentation consisting of 2125 neuroimages of Alzheimer’s disease (n = 975), mild cognitive impairment (n = 538) and cognitive normal (n = 612). For classification, the framework incorporates a Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) followed by some variations of Support Vector Machine (SVM), such as SVM (RBF kernel), SVM (Polynomial Kernel), and SVM (Sigmoid kernel), as well as Gradient Boost (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN). Afterwards, an Ensemble Based Generic Kernel is presented where Master-Slave architecture is combined to attain better performance. The proposed model is an ensemble of Extreme Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree and SVM_Polynomial kernel (XGB + DT + SVM). At last, the proposed method is evaluated using cross-validation using statistical techniques along with other ML models. The presented ensemble model (XGB + DT + SVM) outperformed existing state-of-the-art algorithms with an accuracy of 89.77%. The efficiency of all the models was optimized using Grid-based tuning, and the results obtained after such process showed significant improvement. XGB + DT + SVM with optimized parameters outperformed all other models with an efficiency of 95.75%. The implication of the proposed ensemble-based learning approach clearly shows the best results compared to other ML models. This experimental comparative analysis improved understanding of the above-defined methods and enhanced their scope and significance in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.","","Diagnostics","2","10.3390/diagnostics12123193","https://consensus.app/papers/model-diagnostic-classification-alzheimer-disease-based-khan/7ca1277aa1b9505583d2feb0eca4d490/"
"A Deep Learning Approach for Automated Diagnosis and Multi-Class Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Stages Using Resting-State fMRI and Residual Neural Networks","Resting-state fMRI and Residual Neural Networks can effectively diagnose multiple Alzheimer's disease stages, potentially aiding in early diagnosis.","Farheen Ramzan, Muhammad Usman Ghani Khan, Muhammad Asim Rehmat, S. Iqbal, T. Saba, A. Rehman, Zahid Mehmood",2019,181,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder accounting for 70%–80% dementia cases worldwide. Although, research on AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25 AD) from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100%, 96.85%, 97.38%, 97.43%, 97.40% and 98.01% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92% and 97.88% for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively. The Analysis of results indicate that classification and prediction of neurodegenerative brain disorders such as AD using functional magnetic resonance imaging and advanced deep learning methods is promising for clinical decision making and have the potential to assist in early diagnosis of AD and its associated stages.","non-rct observational study","Journal of Medical Systems","1","10.1007/s10916-019-1475-2","https://consensus.app/papers/deep-learning-approach-automated-diagnosis-multiclass-ramzan/edb0d82bef4259f2b994a91d078140e1/"
"Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Alzheimer's Disease: Overview and Reproducible Evaluation","Different 3D CNN approaches for Alzheimer's disease classification from brain imaging data perform similarly, but 2D slice approaches show lower performance.","Junhao Wen, Elina Thibeau-Sutre, J. Samper-González, A. Routier, Simona Bottani, S. Durrleman, Ninon Burgos, O. Colliot",2019,331,"Numerous machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from brain imaging data. In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics.

"Early-Stage Alzheimer’s Disease Categorization Using PET Neuroimaging Modality and Convolutional Neural Networks in the 2D and 3D Domains","3D-CNN architectures outperform 2D-CNN architectures in accurately classifying early-stage Alzheimer's disease using PET neuroimaging, supporting their use in early diagnosis.","Ahsan Bin Tufail, Nazish Anwar, Mohamed Tahar Ben Othman, Inam Ullah, Rehan Ali Khan, Yong-Kui Ma, Deepak Adhikari, Ateeq ur Rehman, Muhammad Shafiq, Habib Hamam",2022,13,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a health apprehension of significant proportions that is negatively impacting the ageing population globally. It is characterized by neuronal loss and the formation of structures such as neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the early as well as later stages of the disease. Neuroimaging modalities are routinely used in clinical practice to capture brain alterations associated with AD. On the other hand, deep learning methods are routinely used to recognize patterns in underlying data distributions effectively. This work uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures in both 2D and 3D domains to classify the initial stages of AD into AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Normal Control (NC) classes using the positron emission tomography neuroimaging modality deploying data augmentation in a random zoomed in/out scheme. We used novel concepts such as the blurring before subsampling principle and distant domain transfer learning to build 2D CNN architectures. We performed three binaries, that is, AD/NC, AD/MCI, MCI/NC and one multiclass classification task AD/NC/MCI. The statistical comparison revealed that 3D-CNN architecture performed the best achieving an accuracy of 89.21% on AD/NC, 71.70% on AD/MCI, 62.25% on NC/MCI and 59.73% on AD/NC/MCI classification tasks using a five-fold cross-validation hyperparameter selection approach.

Sarica, A. Cerasa, A. Quattrone",2017,342,"Objective: Machine learning classification has been the most important computational development in the last years to satisfy the primary need of clinicians for automatic early diagnosis and prognosis. Nowadays, Random Forest (RF) algorithm has been successfully applied for reducing high dimensional and multi-source data in many scientific realms. Our aim was to explore the state of the art of the application of RF on single and multi-modal neuroimaging data for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted on this field of study. In particular, we constructed an advanced query using boolean operators as follows: (“random forest” OR “random forests”) AND neuroimaging AND (“alzheimer's disease” OR alzheimer's OR alzheimer) AND (prediction OR classification). The query was then searched in four well-known scientific databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Results: Twelve articles—published between the 2007 and 2017—have been included in this systematic review after a quantitative and qualitative selection. The lesson learnt from these works suggest that when RF was applied on multi-modal data for prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) conversion from the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), it produces one of the best accuracies to date. Moreover, the RF has important advantages in terms of robustness to overfitting, ability to handle highly non-linear data, stability in the presence of outliers and opportunity for efficient parallel processing mainly when applied on multi-modality neuroimaging data, such as, MRI morphometric, diffusion tensor imaging, and PET images.

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia that can seriously affect a person's ability to perform daily activities. Estimates indicate that AD may rank third as a cause of death for older people, after heart disease and cancer. Identification of individuals at risk for developing AD is imperative for testing therapeutic interventions. The objective of the study was to determine could diagnostics of AD from EMR data alone (without relying on diagnostic imaging) be significantly improved by applying clinical domain knowledge in data preprocessing and positive dataset selection rather than setting naïve filters.
 
 METHODS
 : Data were extracted from the repository of heterogeneous ambulatory EMR data, collected from primary care medical offices all over the U.S. Medical domain knowledge was applied to build a positive dataset from data relevant to AD. Selected Clinically Relevant Positive (SCRP) datasets were used as inputs to a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning model to predict will the patient develop AD.
 
 RESULTS
 : Risk scores prediction of AD using the drugs domain information in an SCRP AD dataset of 2,324 patients achieved high out-of-sample score - 0.98-0.99 Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) when using 90% of SCRP dataset for training. AUPRC dropped to 0.89 when training the model using less than 1,500 cases from the SCRP dataset. The model was still significantly better than when using naïve dataset selection.
 
 CONCLUSION
 : The LSTM RNN method that used data relevant to AD performed significantly better when learning from the SCRP dataset than when datasets were selected naïvely. The integration of qualitative medical knowledge for dataset selection and deep learning technology provided a mechanism for significant improvement of AD prediction.
 Accurate and early prediction of AD is significant in the identification of patients for clinical trials, which can possibly result in the discovery of new drugs for treatments of AD. Also, the contribution of the proposed predictions of AD is a better selection of patients who need imaging diagnostics for differential diagnosis of AD from other degenerative brain disorders.

"Artificial intelligence and neuropsychological measures: The case of Alzheimer’s disease","Machine learning applied to neuropsychological measures can effectively identify patients with mild cognitive impairment and predict their conversion to Alzheimer's disease, acting as a screening tool rather than a prognosis tool.","P.

It is time to accelerate the translation of this knowledge in clinical practice, mainly by using low-cost features originating from the neuropsychological assessment. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the contribution of ML and neuropsychological measures for the automated classification of MCI patients and the prediction of their conversion to AD. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of patients' classifications was obtained by means of a quantitative bivariate random-effect meta-analytic approach. Although a high heterogeneity was observed, the results of meta-analysis show that ML applied to neuropsychological measures can lead to a successful automatic classification, being more specific as screening rather than prognosis tool. Relevant categories of neuropsychological tests can be extracted by ML that maximize the classification accuracy.","meta-analysis","Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","1","10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.04.026","https://consensus.app/papers/intelligence-measures-case-alzheimer-disease-battista/899aece8a76e5a6aa6abed7ff2bdee98/"
