"Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Alzheimer's Disease: Overview and Reproducible Evaluation","Different 3D CNN approaches for Alzheimer's disease classification from brain imaging data perform similarly, but 2D slice approaches show lower performance.","Junhao Wen, Elina Thibeau-Sutre, J. Samper-González, A. Routier, Simona Bottani, S. Durrleman, Ninon Burgos, O. Colliot",2019,331,"Numerous machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from brain imaging data. In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics. All the code of the framework and the experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-DL.","systematic review","Medical image analysis","1","10.1016/j.media.2020.101694","https://consensus.app/papers/neural-networks-classification-alzheimers-disease-wen/f8b6675994ba54b3a71585ae12d20157/"
"Diagnostic Performance of Generative Adversarial Network-Based Deep Learning Methods for Alzheimer’s Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The GAN-based deep learning method performed well in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease compared to cognitively normal individuals, but its diagnostic performance in progressing MCI vs. stable MCI classification needs improvement.","Changxing Qu, Yinxi Zou, Yingqiao Ma, Qin Chen, Jiawei Luo, Huiyong Fan, Z. Jia, Q. Gong, Taolin Chen",2022,2,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Currently, only symptomatic management is available, and early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for AD treatment. As a recent deep learning strategy, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are expected to benefit AD diagnosis, but their performance remains to be verified. This study provided a systematic review on the application of the GAN-based deep learning method in the diagnosis of AD and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate its diagnostic performance. A search of the following electronic databases was performed by two researchers independently in August 2021: MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was applied to assess the quality of the included studies. The accuracy of the model applied in the diagnosis of AD was determined by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A bivariate random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity with their 95% CIs. Fourteen studies were included, 11 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The overall quality of the included studies was high according to the QUADAS-2 assessment. For the AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) classification, the GAN-based deep learning method exhibited better performance than the non-GAN method, with significantly higher accuracy (OR 1.425, 95% CI: 1.150–1.766, P = 0.001), pooled sensitivity (0.88 vs. 0.83), pooled specificity (0.93 vs. 0.89), and area under the curve (AUC) of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) (0.96 vs. 0.93). For the progressing MCI (pMCI) vs. stable MCI (sMCI) classification, the GAN method exhibited no significant increase in the accuracy (OR 1.149, 95% CI: 0.878–1.505, P = 0.310) or the pooled sensitivity (0.66 vs. 0.66). The pooled specificity and AUC of the SROC in the GAN group were slightly higher than those in the non-GAN group (0.81 vs. 0.78 and 0.81 vs. 0.80, respectively). The present results suggested that the GAN-based deep learning method performed well in the task of AD vs. CN classification. However, the diagnostic performance of GAN in the task of pMCI vs. sMCI classification needs to be improved.

"Optimizing Machine Learning Methods to Improve Predictive Models of Alzheimer's Disease.","Ensemble linear discriminant models using demographics and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging measures effectively classify cognitively normal individuals from Alzheimer's disease and predict the clinical course of mild cognitive impairment.","A. Ezzati, Andrea R Zammit, D. Harvey, C. Habeck, C. Hall, R. Lipton",2019,23,"BACKGROUND
Predicting clinical course of cognitive decline can boost clinical trials' power and improve our clinical decision-making. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are specifically designed for the purpose of prediction; however. identifying optimal features or algorithms is still a challenge.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the accuracy of different ML methods and different features to classify cognitively normal (CN) individuals from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to predict longitudinal outcome in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).


METHODS
A total of 1,329 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included: 424 CN, 656 MCI, and 249 AD individuals. Four feature-sets at baseline (hippocampal volume and volume of 47 cortical and subcortical regions with and without demographics and APOE4) and six machine learning methods (decision trees, support vector machines, K-nearest neighbor, ensemble linear discriminant, boosted trees, and random forests) were used to classify participants with normal cognition from participants with AD. Subsequently the model with best classification performance was used for predicting clinical outcome of MCI participants.


RESULTS
Ensemble linear discriminant models using demographics and all volumetric magnetic resonance imaging measures as feature-set showed the best performance in classification of CN versus AD participants (accuracy = 92.8%, sensitivity = 95.8%, and specificity = 88.3%). Prediction accuracy of future conversion from MCI to AD for this ensemble linear discriminant at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months was 63.8% (sensitivity = 74.4, specificity = 63.1), 68.9% (sensitivity = 75.9, specificity = 67.8), 74.9% (sensitivity = 71.5, specificity = 76.3), 75.3%, (sensitivity = 65.2, specificity = 79.7), and 77.0% (sensitivity = 59.6, specificity = 86.1), respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Machine learning models trained for classification of CN versus AD can improve our prediction ability of MCI conversion to AD.","non-rct observational study","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","1","10.3233/JAD-190262","https://consensus.app/papers/optimizing-machine-learning-methods-improve-predictive-ezzati/b495f116d491558cbeaf9f97ab11b91b/"
"Enhancing magnetic resonance imaging-driven Alzheimer’s disease classification performance using generative adversarial learning","GAN frameworks can enhance Alzheimer's disease classification performance and improve image quality using MRI scans of different magnetic field strengths.","Xiaoping Zhou, S. Qiu, P. Joshi, Chonghua Xue, R. Killiany, A. Mian, S. Chin, R. Au, V. Kolachalama",2021,32,"Background Generative adversarial networks (GAN) can produce images of improved quality but their ability to augment image-based classification is not fully explored. We evaluated if a modified GAN can learn from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of multiple magnetic field strengths to enhance Alzheimer’s disease (AD) classification performance. Methods T1-weighted brain MRI scans from 151 participants of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), who underwent both 1.5-Tesla (1.5-T) and 3-Tesla imaging at the same time were selected to construct a GAN model. This model was trained along with a three-dimensional fully convolutional network (FCN) using the generated images (3T*) as inputs to predict AD status. Quality of the generated images was evaluated using signal to noise ratio (SNR), Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) and Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE). Cases from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL, n  = 107) and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC, n  = 565) were used for model validation. Results The 3T*-based FCN classifier performed better than the FCN model trained using the 1.5-T scans. Specifically, the mean area under curve increased from 0.907 to 0.932, from 0.934 to 0.940, and from 0.870 to 0.907 on the ADNI test, AIBL, and NACC datasets, respectively. Additionally, we found that the mean quality of the generated (3T*) images was consistently higher than the 1.5-T images, as measured using SNR, BRISQUE, and NIQE on the validation datasets. Conclusion This study demonstrates a proof of principle that GAN frameworks can be constructed to augment AD classification performance and improve image quality.","","Alzheimer's Research & Therapy","1","10.1186/s13195-021-00797-5","https://consensus.app/papers/enhancing-resonance-imagingdriven-alzheimer-disease-zhou/d97ac3b942da5303b22f305c6ac5a878/"
"Reproducible evaluation of classification methods in Alzheimer's disease: Framework and application to MRI and PET data","The proposed framework for reproducible and objective Alzheimer's disease classification experiments using public datasets, shows that FDG PET outperforms T1 MRI and linear SVM and L2-logistic regression perform similarly.","J.

Evgeniou, O. Colliot, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative",2018,132,"&NA; A large number of papers have introduced novel machine learning and feature extraction methods for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, while the vast majority of these works use the public dataset ADNI for evaluation, they are difficult to reproduce because different key components of the validation are often not readily available. These components include selected participants and input data, image preprocessing and cross‐validation procedures. The performance of the different approaches is also difficult to compare objectively. In particular, it is often difficult to assess which part of the method (e.g. preprocessing, feature extraction or classification algorithms) provides a real improvement, if any. In the present paper, we propose a framework for reproducible and objective classification experiments in AD using three publicly available datasets (ADNI, AIBL and OASIS). The framework comprises: i) automatic conversion of the three datasets into a standard format (BIDS); ii) a modular set of preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction and classification methods, together with an evaluation framework, that provide a baseline for benchmarking the different components. We demonstrate the use of the framework for a large‐scale evaluation on 1960 participants using T1 MRI and FDG PET data. In this evaluation, we assess the influence of different modalities, preprocessing, feature types (regional or voxel‐based features), classifiers, training set sizes and datasets. Performances were in line with the state‐of‐the‐art. FDG PET outperformed T1 MRI for all classification tasks. No difference in performance was found for the use of different atlases, image smoothing, partial volume correction of FDG PET images, or feature type. Linear SVM and L2‐logistic regression resulted in similar performance and both outperformed random forests. The classification performance increased along with the number of subjects used for training. Classifiers trained on ADNI generalized well to AIBL and OASIS.

"AlzheimerNet: An Effective Deep Learning Based Proposition for Alzheimer’s Disease Stages Classification From Functional Brain Changes in Magnetic Resonance Images","The AlzheimerNet model effectively classifies Alzheimer's disease stages from brain MRI, outperforming traditional methods with a significance of 0.05.","F M Javed Mehedi Shamrat, Shamima Akter, S. Azam, Asif Karim, Pronab Ghosh, Zarrin Tasnim, Khan Md Hasib, F. De Boer, Kawsar Ahmed",2023,15,"Alzheimer’s disease is largely the underlying cause of dementia due to its progressive neurodegenerative nature among the elderly. The disease can be divided into five stages: Subjective Memory Concern (SMC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Alzheimer’s disease is conventionally diagnosed using an MRI scan of the brain. In this research, we propose a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier called AlzheimerNet, which can identify all five stages of Alzheimer’s disease and the Normal Control (NC) class. The ADNI database’s MRI scan dataset is obtained for use in training and testing the proposed model. To prepare the raw data for analysis, we applied the CLAHE image enhancement method. Data augmentation was used to remedy the unbalanced nature of the dataset and the resultant dataset consisted of 60000 image data on the 6 classes. Initially, five existing models including VGG16, MobileNetV2, AlexNet, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 were trained and tested to achieve test accuracies of 78.84%, 86.85%, 78.87%, 80.98% and 96.31% respectively. Since InceptionV3 provides the highest accuracy, this model is later modified to design the AlzheimerNet using RMSprop optimizer and learning rate 0.00001 to achieve the highest test accuracy of 98.67%. The five pre-trained models and the proposed fine-tuned model were compared in terms of various performance matrices to demonstrate whether the AlzheimerNet model is in fact performing better in classifying and detecting the six classes. An ablation study shows the hyperparameters used in the experiment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe health problem. Challenges still remain in early diagnosis.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to build a Stacking framework for multi-classification of AD by a combination of neuroimaging and clinical features to improve the performance.


METHODS
The data we used were from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database with a total of 493 subjects, including 125 normal control (NC), 121 early mild cognitive impairment, 109 late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 138 AD. We selected structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) features by voting strategy. The imaging features, demographic information, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale were combined together as classification features. We proposed a two-layer Stacking ensemble framework to classify four types of people. The first layer represented support vector machine, random forests, adaptive boosting, and gradient boosting decision tree; the second layer was a logistic regression classifier. Additionally, we analyzed performance of only sMRI feature and combined features and compared the proposed model with four base classifiers.


RESULTS
The Stacking model combined with sMRI and non-imaging features outshined four base classifiers with an average accuracy of 86.96% . Compared with using sMRI data alone, sMRI combined with non-imaging features significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, especially in NC versus LMCI and LMCI versus AD by 14.08% .

However, the effects of noise and blurring on 18F-FDG PET images were not considered. The performance of a classification model trained using raw, deblurred (by the fast total variation deblurring method), or denoised (by the median modified Wiener filter) 18F-FDG PET images without or with cropping around the limbic system area using a 3D deep convolutional neural network was investigated. The classification model trained using denoised whole-brain 18F-FDG PET images achieved classification performance (0.75/0.65/0.79/0.39 for sensitivity/specificity/F1-score/Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively) higher than that with raw and deblurred 18F-FDG PET images. The classification model trained using cropped raw 18F-FDG PET images achieved higher performance (0.78/0.63/0.81/0.40 for sensitivity/specificity/F1-score/MCC) than the whole-brain 18F-FDG PET images (0.72/0.32/0.71/0.10 for sensitivity/specificity/F1-score/MCC, respectively). The 18F-FDG PET image deblurring and cropping (0.89/0.67/0.88/0.57 for sensitivity/specificity/F1-score/MCC) procedures were the most helpful for improving performance.

As one of the promising techniques, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been widely employed to support early-stage AD diagnosis. This study aims to validate the capability of fNIRS coupled with Deep Learning (DL) models for AD multi-class classification. First, a comprehensive experimental design, including the resting, cognitive, memory, and verbal tasks was conducted. Second, to precisely evaluate the AD progression, we thoroughly examined the change of hemodynamic responses measured in the prefrontal cortex among four subject groups and among genders. Then, we adopted a set of DL architectures on an extremely imbalanced fNIRS dataset. The results indicated that the statistical difference between subject groups did exist during memory and verbal tasks. This presented the correlation of the level of hemoglobin activation and the degree of AD severity. There was also a gender effect on the hemoglobin changes due to the functional stimulation in our study. Moreover, we demonstrated the potential of distinguished DL models, which boosted the multi-class classification performance. The highest accuracy was achieved by Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) using the original dataset of three hemoglobin types (0.909 ± 0.012 on average). Compared to conventional machine learning algorithms, DL models produced a better classification performance. These findings demonstrated the capability of DL frameworks on the imbalanced class distribution analysis and validated the great potential of fNIRS-based approaches to be further contributed to the development of AD diagnosis systems.","non-rct experimental","Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience","1","10.3389/fnagi.2022.810125","https://consensus.app/papers/deep-learningbased-multilevel-classification-alzheimer-ho/033eb57937355069855ba1795f9781aa/"
