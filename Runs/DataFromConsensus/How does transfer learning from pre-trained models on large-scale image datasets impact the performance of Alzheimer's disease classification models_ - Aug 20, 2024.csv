"Transfer Learning for Alzheimer’s Disease through Neuroimaging Biomarkers: A Systematic Review","Transfer learning using 3D convolutional networks and local transfer learning improves early Alzheimer's disease detection and progression prediction accuracy.","Deevyankar Agarwal, Gonçalo Marques, I. D. L. T. Díez, M. Martín, B. G. Zapirain, Francisco Martín‐Rodríguez",2021,22,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a remarkable challenge for healthcare in the 21st century. Since 2017, deep learning models with transfer learning approaches have been gaining recognition in AD detection, and progression prediction by using neuroimaging biomarkers. This paper presents a systematic review of the current state of early AD detection by using deep learning models with transfer learning and neuroimaging biomarkers. Five databases were used and the results before screening report 215 studies published between 2010 and 2020. After screening, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. We noted that the maximum accuracy achieved to date for AD classification is 98.20% by using the combination of 3D convolutional networks and local transfer learning, and that for the prognostic prediction of AD is 87.78% by using pre-trained 3D convolutional network-based architectures. The results show that transfer learning helps researchers in developing a more accurate system for the early diagnosis of AD. However, there is a need to consider some points in future research, such as improving the accuracy of the prognostic prediction of AD, exploring additional biomarkers such as tau-PET and amyloid-PET to understand highly discriminative feature representation to separate similar brain patterns, managing the size of the datasets due to the limited availability.","systematic review","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","1","10.3390/s21217259","https://consensus.app/papers/transfer-learning-alzheimer-disease-neuroimaging-agarwal/862c75a340a7540b876fc97d6be79671/"
"Transfer Learning With Intelligent Training Data Selection for Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease","Transfer learning with intelligent training data selection, using pre-trained weights from natural images, can improve Alzheimer's disease detection from neuroimaging data, with a 4% and 7% increase in accuracy.","N. Khan, Nabila Abraham, Marcia Hon",2019,95,"Detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from neuroimaging data such as MRI through machine learning has been a subject of intense research in recent years. The recent success of deep learning in computer vision has progressed such research. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and the requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer learning, where the state-of-the-art VGG architecture is initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural images. The network is then fine-tuned with layer-wise tuning, where only a pre-defined group of layers are trained on MRI images. To shrink the training data size, we employ image entropy to select the most informative slices. Through experimentation on the ADNI dataset, we show that with the training size of 10 to 20 times smaller than the other contemporary methods, we reach the state-of-the-art performance in AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. NC classification problems, with a 4% and a 7% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art for AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC, respectively. We also provide a detailed analysis of the effect of the intelligent training data selection method, changing the training size, and changing the number of layers to be fine-tuned. Finally, we provide class activation maps (CAM) that demonstrate how the proposed model focuses on discriminative image regions that are neuropathologically relevant and can help the healthcare practitioner in interpreting the model’s decision-making process.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920448","https://consensus.app/papers/transfer-learning-with-intelligent-training-data-khan/28e8d4ec3a53521bb00539c557895855/"
"A practical Alzheimer’s disease classifier via brain imaging-based deep learning on 85,721 samples","The proposed Alzheimer's disease classifier using deep learning on 85,721 MRI scans achieved 94.9% accuracy, offering a medical-grade biomarker for integrated diagnostic practice.","Bin Lu, Hui-Xian Li, Zhi-Kai Chang, Le Li, Ning-Xuan Chen, Zhi-Chen Zhu, Hui Zhou, Xue-Ying Li, Yu-Wei Wang, Shiyao Cui, Z. Deng, Zhen Fan, Hong Yang, Xiao Chen, Paul M. Thompson, F. Castellanos, Chaogan Yan",2022,35,"Beyond detecting brain lesions or tumors, comparatively little success has been attained in identifying brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many machine learning algorithms to detect AD have been trained using limited training data, meaning they often generalize poorly when applied to scans from previously unseen populations. Here we aimed to build a practical brain imaging-based AD diagnostic classifier using deep learning/transfer learning on dataset of unprecedented size and diversity. We pooled MRI data from more than 217 sites/scanners to constitute the largest brain MRI sample to date (85,721 scans from 50,876 participants). Next, we applied a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, Inception-ResNet-V2, to build a sex classifier with high generalization capability. The sex classifier achieved 94.9% accuracy and served as a base model in transfer learning for the objective diagnosis of AD. After transfer learning, the model fine-tuned for AD classification achieved 91.3% accuracy in leave-sites-out cross-validation on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and 94.2%/87.9% accuracy for direct tests on two unseen independent datasets (AIBL/OASIS). When this AD classifier was tested on brain images from unseen mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, MCI patients who finally converted to AD were 3 times more likely to be predicted as AD than MCI patients who did not convert (65.2% vs 20.6%). Predicted scores from the AD classifier showed significant correlations with illness severity. In sum, the proposed AD classifier could offer a medical-grade biomarker that could be integrated into AD diagnostic practice. Our trained model, code and preprocessed data are freely available to the research community.","","Journal of Big Data","1","10.1186/s40537-022-00650-y","https://consensus.app/papers/alzheimer-disease-classifier-brain-learning-85721-lu/21a6d7aeed065281993c2f5783a2269f/"

The detection of disease at an early stage in the absence of a large-scale annotated dataset is crucial to the clinical treatment for the prevention and early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we propose a transfer learning base approach to classify various stages of AD. The proposed model can distinguish between normal control (NC), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and AD. In this regard, we apply tissue segmentation to extract the gray matter from the MRI scans obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease National Initiative (ADNI) database. We utilize this gray matter to tune the pre-trained VGG architecture while freezing the features of the ImageNet database. It is achieved through the addition of a layer with step-wise freezing of the existing blocks in the network. It not only assists transfer learning but also contributes to learning new features efficiently. Extensive experiments are conducted and results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.","","Frontiers in Neuroscience","2","10.3389/fnins.2022.1050777","https://consensus.app/papers/transfer-learning-approach-multiclass-classification-khan/9cee091a3c1655d28a4c9cd8052b0d1e/"
"Improving Alzheimer's stage categorization with Convolutional Neural Network using transfer learning and different magnetic resonance imaging modalities","Our proposed method using Convolutional Neural Networks improves Alzheimer's stage classification accuracy using low-resolution MRI and DTI scans, even on small datasets.","Karim Aderghal, K. Afdel, J. Benois-Pineau, G. Catheline",2020,40,"Background Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of memory and general decline in cognitive functions. Multi-modal imaging such as structural MRI and DTI provide useful information for the classification of patients on the basis of brain biomarkers. Recently, CNN methods have emerged as powerful tools to improve classification using images. New Method In this paper, we propose a transfer learning scheme using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify brain scans focusing only on a small ROI: e.g. a few slices of the hippocampal region. The network's architecture is similar to a LeNet-like CNN upon which models are built and fused for AD stage classification diagnosis. We evaluated various types of transfer learning through the following mechanisms: (i) cross-modal (sMRI and DTI) and (ii) cross-domain transfer learning (using MNIST) (iii) a hybrid transfer learning of both types. Results Our method shows good performances even on small datasets and with a limited number of slices of small brain region. It increases accuracy with more than 5 points for the most difficult classification tasks, i.e., AD/MCI and MCI/NC. Comparison with Existing Method(s) Our methodology provides good accuracy scores for classification over a shallow convolutional network. Besides, we focused only on a small region; i.e., the hippocampal region, where few slices are selected to feed the network. Also, we used cross-modal transfer learning. Conclusions Our proposed method is suitable for working with a shallow CNN network for low-resolution MRI and DTI scans. It yields to significant results even if the model is trained on small datasets, which is often the case in medical image analysis.","","Heliyon","1","10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05652","https://consensus.app/papers/improving-alzheimers-stage-categorization-aderghal/a1c2580004a55747a013d49328649468/"

"A Transfer Learning Method for Detecting Alzheimer's Disease Based on Speech and Natural Language Processing","The transfer learning model based on speech and NLP technology improves Alzheimer's disease detection, reducing feature engineering and dataset limitations, with an accuracy of 0.88.","Ning-hong Liu, Kexue Luo, Zhenming Yuan, Yan Chen",2022,11,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is difficult to be detected using convenient and reliable methods. The language change in patients with AD is an important signal of their cognitive status, which potentially helps in early diagnosis. In this study, we developed a transfer learning model based on speech and natural language processing (NLP) technology for the early diagnosis of AD. The lack of large datasets limits the use of complex neural network models without feature engineering, while transfer learning can effectively solve this problem. The transfer learning model is firstly pre-trained on large text datasets to get the pre-trained language model, and then, based on such a model, an AD classification model is performed on small training sets. Concretely, a distilled bidirectional encoder representation (distilBert) embedding, combined with a logistic regression classifier, is used to distinguish AD from normal controls. The model experiment was evaluated on Alzheimer's dementia recognition through spontaneous speech datasets in 2020, including the balanced 78 healthy controls (HC) and 78 patients with AD. The accuracy of the proposed model is 0.88, which is almost equivalent to the champion score in the challenge and a considerable improvement over the baseline of 75% established by organizers of the challenge. As a result, the transfer learning method in this study improves AD prediction, which does not only reduces the need for feature engineering but also addresses the lack of sufficiently large datasets.","","Frontiers in Public Health","1","10.3389/fpubh.2022.772592","https://consensus.app/papers/transfer-learning-method-detecting-alzheimers-disease-liu/a6e5101d222b5b6389d8ba659bb35be9/"
"Deep transfer learning-based fully automated detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease on brain MRI.","Deep transfer learning algorithms can accurately detect and classify Alzheimer's disease using brain MRI, potentially aiding clinicians in creating objective opinions and correct diagnoses.","H. Ghaffari, H. Tavakoli, Gila Pirzad Jahromi",2022,10,"OBJECTIVES
To employ different automated convolutional neural network (CNN)-based transfer learning (TL) methods for both binary and multi class classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using brain MRI.


METHODS
Herein, we applied three popular pre-trained CNN models (ResNet101, Xception, and InceptionV3) using a fine-tuned approach of TL on 3D T1-weighted brain MRI from a subset of ADNI dataset (n = 305 subjects). To evaluate power of TL, the aforementioned networks were also trained from scratch for performance comparison. Initially, Unet network segmentedthe MRI scans into characteristic components of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The proposed networks were trained and tested over the pre-processed and augmented segmented and whole images for both binary (NC/AD + progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) +stable MCI (sMCI)) and 4-class (AD/pMCI/sMCI/NC) classification. Also, two independent test sets from the OASIS (n = 30) and AIBL (n = 60) datasets were used to externally assess the performance of the proposed algorithms.


RESULTS
The proposed TL-based CNN models achieved better performance compared to the training CNN models from scratch. On the ADNI test set, InceptionV3-TL achieved the highest accuracy of 93.75% and AUC of 92.0% for binary classification, as well as the highest accuracy of 93.75% and AUC of 96.0% for multi class classification of AD on the whole images. On the OASIS test set, InceptionV3-TL outperformed two other models by achieving 93.33% accuracy with 93.0% AUC in binary classification of AD on the whole images. On the AIBL test set, InceptionV3-TL also outperformed two other models in both binary and multiclass classification tasks on the whole MR images and achieved accuracy/AUC of 93.33%/95.0 and 90.0%/93.0%, respectively. The GM segment as input provided the highest performance in both binary and multi class classification of AD, as compared to the WM and CSF segments.


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the potential of applying deep TL approach for automated detection and classification of AD using brain MRI with high accuracy and robustness across internal and external test data, suggesting that these models can possibly be used as a supportive tool to assist clinicians in creating objective opinion and correct diagnosis.


ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE
We used CNN-based TL approaches and the augmentation techniques to overcome the insufficient data problem. Our study provides evidence that deep TL algorithms can be used for both binary and multi class classification of AD with high accuracy.","","The British journal of radiology","2","10.1259/bjr.20211253","https://consensus.app/papers/deep-transfer-learningbased-fully-automated-detection-ghaffari/c75a04ed220750f59b3af73f48a0be7e/"
"Evaluation of Transfer Learning Methods for Detecting Alzheimer’s Disease with Brain MRI","Pre-trained 3D CNNs with contrastive learning outperform the baseline by 2.8% in Alzheimer's disease classification using T1-weighted brain MRI scans, offering significant benefits in low data regimes.","N.

Thompson",2022,9,"Deep neural networks show great promise for classifying brain diseases and making prognostic assessments based on neuroimaging data, but large, labeled training datasets are often required to achieve high predictive accuracy. Here we evaluated a range of transfer learning or pre-training strategies to create useful MRI representations for downstream tasks that lack large amounts of training data, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) classification. To test our models, we analyzed 4,098 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and independently validated our proposed methods for detecting AD with an out-of-distribution test set of 600 scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS3) cohort. First, we trained 3D and 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We tested combinations of multiple pre-training strategies based on (1) supervised, (2) contrastive learning, and (3) self-supervised learning - using pre-training data within versus outside the MRI domain. In our experiments, the 3D CNN pre-trained with contrastive learning provided the best overall results - when fine-tuned on T1-weighted scans for AD classification - outperformed the baseline by 2.8% when trained with all of the training data from ADNI. We also show test performance as a function of the training dataset size and the chosen pre-training method. Transfer learning offered significant benefits in low data regimes, with a performance boost of 7.7%. When the pretrained model was used for AD classification, we were able to visualize an improved clustering of test subjects’ diagnostic groups, as illustrated via a uniform manifold approximation (UMAP) projection of the high-dimensional model embedding space. Further, saliency maps indicate the additional activation regions in the brain scan using pretraining, that then maximally contributed towards the final prediction score.","","bioRxiv","","10.1101/2022.08.23.505030","https://consensus.app/papers/evaluation-transfer-learning-methods-detecting-dhinagar/7dbaf6a6ba945a54a551e3870dd2d666/"
