"Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Ensemble of Deep Neural Networks Trained Through Transfer Learning","The Deep Transfer Ensemble (DTE) effectively classifies Alzheimer's disease using MRI scans, achieving high accuracy and outperforming snapshot ensembles and other existing deep models.","M. Tanveer, A. H. Rashid, M. A. Ganaie, Motahar Reza, Imran Razzak, K. Hua",2021,51,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the deadliest neurodegenerative diseases ailing the elderly population all over the world. An ensemble of Deep learning (DL) models can learn highly complicated patterns from MRI scans for the detection of AD by utilizing diverse solutions. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient, DL-architecture agnostic, ensemble of deep neural networks, named ‘Deep Transfer Ensemble (DTE)’ trained using transfer learning for the classification of AD. DTE leverages the complementary feature views and diversity introduced by many different locally optimum solutions reached by individual networks through the randomization of hyper-parameters. DTE achieves an accuracy of 99.05% and 85.27% on two independent splits of the large dataset for cognitively normal (NC) vs AD classification task. For the task of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs AD classification, DTE achieves 98.71% and 83.11% respectively on the two independent splits. It also performs reasonable on a small dataset consisting of only 50 samples per class. It achieved a maximum accuracy of 85% for NC vs AD on the small dataset. It also outperformed snapshot ensembles along with several other existing deep models from similar kind of previous works by other researchers.","","IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","1","10.1109/JBHI.2021.3083274","https://consensus.app/papers/classification-alzheimer-disease-using-ensemble-deep-tanveer/dcb31e0845d45e0a932c8ca9d51957fb/"
"A3C-TL-GTO: Alzheimer Automatic Accurate Classification Using Transfer Learning and Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer","The A3C-TL-GTO framework accurately classifies Alzheimer's patients using MRI images, providing a significant advantage for patient care and early diagnosis.","Nadiah A. Baghdadi, Amer Malki, H. M. Balaha, M. Badawy, Mostafa A. Elhosseini",2022,9,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic disease that affects the elderly. There are many different types of dementia, but Alzheimer’s disease is one of the leading causes of death. AD is a chronic brain disorder that leads to problems with language, disorientation, mood swings, bodily functions, memory loss, cognitive decline, mood or personality changes, and ultimately death due to dementia. Unfortunately, no cure has yet been developed for it, and it has no known causes. Clinically, imaging tools can aid in the diagnosis, and deep learning has recently emerged as an important component of these tools. Deep learning requires little or no image preprocessing and can infer an optimal data representation from raw images without prior feature selection. As a result, they produce a more objective and less biased process. The performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is primarily affected by the hyperparameters chosen and the dataset used. A deep learning model for classifying Alzheimer’s patients has been developed using transfer learning and optimized by Gorilla Troops for early diagnosis. This study proposes the A3C-TL-GTO framework for MRI image classification and AD detection. The A3C-TL-GTO is an empirical quantitative framework for accurate and automatic AD classification, developed and evaluated with the Alzheimer’s Dataset (four classes of images) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The proposed framework reduces the bias and variability of preprocessing steps and hyperparameters optimization to the classifier model and dataset used. Our strategy, evaluated on MRIs, is easily adaptable to other imaging methods. According to our findings, the proposed framework was an excellent instrument for this task, with a significant potential advantage for patient care. The ADNI dataset, an online dataset on Alzheimer’s disease, was used to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MR) brain images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 96.65% accuracy for the Alzheimer’s Dataset and 96.25% accuracy for the ADNI dataset. Moreover, a better performance in terms of accuracy is demonstrated over other state-of-the-art approaches.","","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","1","10.3390/s22114250","https://consensus.app/papers/a3ctlgto-alzheimer-automatic-accurate-classification-baghdadi/d835fb3a4c585ae9b8e592b1726e5969/"
"Deep transfer learning for alzheimer neurological disorder detection","DenseNet outperforms other CNN models in Alzheimer disease classification, achieving a maximal average accuracy of 99.05 on the ADNI dataset.","Abida Ashraf, S. Naz, S. H. Shirazi, Imran Razzak, Mukesh Parsad",2021,47,"Alzheimer’s disease is becoming common in the world with the time. It is an irreversible and progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys the memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to perform the simplest tasks. It becomes severe before the noticeable symptoms appear and causes brain disorder which cannot be cured by any medicines and therapies, however its progression can be slow down through early diagnosis. In this paper, we employed different CNN based transfer learning methods for Alzheimer disease classification. We have applied different parameters, and achieved remarkable accuracy on benchmark ADNI dataset. We have tested 13 differnt flavours of different pre-trained CNN models using a fine-tuned approach of transfer learning across two different domain on ADNI dataset (94 AD, 138 MCI and 146 NC). Comparatively, DenseNet showed better performance by achieving a maximal average accuracy of % 99.05.

"Stacked Deep Dense Neural Network Model to Predict Alzheimer’s Dementia Using Audio Transcript Data","The proposed Stacked Deep Dense Neural Network model significantly improves Alzheimer's dementia classification accuracy to 93.31% when applied with Glove embedding and hyperparameter tuning.","Yusera Farooq Khan, B. Kaushik, Mohammad Khalid Imam Rahmani, Md. Ezaz Ahmed",2022,10,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is caused by cortical degeneration leading to memory loss and dementia. A possible criterion for the early identification of Alzheimer’s dementia is to identify the difference between positive and negative linguistic and cognitive abilities of the patients. This study involves the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), designed a hybrid model with CNN & Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bidirectional LSTM), and proposed a Stacked Deep Dense Neural Network (SDDNN) model for text classification and prediction of Alzheimer’s dementia. These models were trained end-to-end using DementiaBank clinical transcript dataset. The transcripts consisted of recorded interviews of Alzheimer’s patients with clinical experts. The models were investigated under two settings: Randomly initialized and Glove embedding. Further, hyperparameter optimization was accomplished using GridSearch, which yielded optimal parameters for the design of suitable learning models for most accurate predictions. Other parameters were computed and compared based on AUC, accuracy, specificity, precision, F1 score, and recall. To ensure performance generalization, the classification accuracy was tested using 10-fold cross-validation approach. The performance and classification accuracy of the proposed model was significantly improved to 93.31% when applied with Glove embedding and hyperparameter tuning.

"Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using Gaussian-Based Bayesian Parameter Optimization for Deep Convolutional LSTM Network","Bayesian optimization and long short-term memory (LSTM) in convolutional neural networks can improve early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis by optimizing hyperparameters and reducing experimentation time.","Monika Sethi, S. Ahuja, Shalli Rani, Puneet Bawa, Atef Zaguia",2021,18,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most important causes of mortality in elderly people, and it is often challenging to use traditional manual procedures when diagnosing a disease in the early stages. The successful implementation of machine learning (ML) techniques has also shown their effectiveness and its reliability as one of the better options for an early diagnosis of AD. But the heterogeneous dimensions and composition of the disease data have undoubtedly made diagnostics more difficult, needing a sufficient model choice to overcome the difficulty. Therefore, in this paper, four different 2D and 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks based on Bayesian search optimization are proposed to develop an optimized deep learning model to predict the early onset of AD binary and ternary classification on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Moreover, certain hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizers, and hidden units are to be set and adjusted for the performance boosting of the deep learning model. Bayesian optimization enables to leverage advantage throughout the experiments: A persistent hyperparameter space testing provides not only the output but also about the nearest conclusions. In this way, the series of experiments needed to explore space can be substantially reduced. Finally, alongside the use of Bayesian approaches, long short-term memory (LSTM) through the process of augmentation has resulted in finding the better settings of the model that too in less iterations with an relative improvement (RI) of 7.03%, 12.19%, 10.80%, and 11.99% over the four systems optimized with manual hyperparameters tuning such that hyperparameters that look more appealing from past data as well as the conventional techniques of manual selection.","","Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine","2","10.1155/2021/4186666","https://consensus.app/papers/classification-alzheimers-disease-using-gaussianbased-sethi/9834b187ba38502e85eaa42e388538ea/"
"Deep Learning-Based Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation","Transfer learning and data augmentation techniques effectively improve the accuracy of deep learning models for Alzheimer's disease classification, leading to more accurate diagnostic tools.","Deva Anand, P. Gowr, S.Logesh, S.M.Anand",2023,0,"Alzheimer's disease is a pressing healthcare concern worldwide, highlighting the importance of early and accurate detection. Deep learning models, particularly those utilizing transfer learning, have shown promise for AD classification. This research study explores the effectiveness of transfer learning in training models based on deep learning for the classification of Alzheimer's condition. We trained several transfer models using DenseNet121, InceptionV3, Xception, and ResNet101. Based on performance evaluation, InceptionV3 was selected as the base model, outperforming in comparison to the accuracy of the other models. To enhance the accuracy of the InceptionV3 base model, we added capacity, tuned hyperparameters using Keras tuner, and utilized data augmentation techniques. The final model was trained on the Kaggle Alzheimer's Dataset, consisting of 4 classes of images, and achieving an AUC value of 87%. Our research demonstrates that transfer learning and other data augmentation approaches are useful in improving the accuracy of deep learning models for the categorization of Alzheimer's condition. This research has practical implications for improving public health outcomes, facilitating timely intervention and effective treatment.

"A Tensorized Multitask Deep Learning Network for Progression Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease","The KTMnet deep neural network effectively performs multiclass classification and longitudinal regression simultaneously, enhancing the efficacy of both tasks for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and prediction.","Solale Tabarestani, M. Eslami, M. Cabrerizo, R. Curiel, A. Barreto, N. Rishe, David E Vaillancourt, S. DeKosky, D. Loewenstein, R. Duara, M. Adjouadi",2022,2,"With the advances in machine learning for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), most studies have focused on either identifying the subject’s status through classification algorithms or on predicting their cognitive scores through regression methods, neglecting the potential association between these two tasks. Motivated by the need to enhance the prospects for early diagnosis along with the ability to predict future disease states, this study proposes a deep neural network based on modality fusion, kernelization, and tensorization that perform multiclass classification and longitudinal regression simultaneously within a unified multitask framework. This relationship between multiclass classification and longitudinal regression is found to boost the efficacy of the final model in dealing with both tasks. Different multimodality scenarios are investigated, and complementary aspects of the multimodal features are exploited to simultaneously delineate the subject’s label and predict related cognitive scores at future timepoints using baseline data. The main intent in this multitask framework is to consolidate the highest accuracy possible in terms of precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) in the multiclass classification task while maintaining the highest similarity in the MMSE score as measured through the correlation coefficient and the RMSE for all time points under the prediction task, with both tasks, run simultaneously under the same set of hyperparameters. The overall accuracy for multiclass classification of the proposed KTMnet method is 66.85 ± 3.77. The prediction results show an average RMSE of 2.32 ± 0.52 and a correlation of 0.71 ± 5.98 for predicting MMSE throughout the time points. These results are compared to state-of-the-art techniques reported in the literature. A discovery from the multitasking of this consolidated machine learning framework is that a set of hyperparameters that optimize the prediction results may not necessarily be the same as those that would optimize the multiclass classification. In other words, there is a breakpoint beyond which enhancing further the results of one process could lead to the downgrading in accuracy for the other.","","Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience","1","10.3389/fnagi.2022.810873","https://consensus.app/papers/tensorized-multitask-deep-learning-network-progression-tabarestani/c5c3223ae6425bda86bb71d5ae2aead1/"

Since 2017, deep learning models with transfer learning approaches have been gaining recognition in AD detection, and progression prediction by using neuroimaging biomarkers. This paper presents a systematic review of the current state of early AD detection by using deep learning models with transfer learning and neuroimaging biomarkers. Five databases were used and the results before screening report 215 studies published between 2010 and 2020. After screening, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. We noted that the maximum accuracy achieved to date for AD classification is 98.20% by using the combination of 3D convolutional networks and local transfer learning, and that for the prognostic prediction of AD is 87.78% by using pre-trained 3D convolutional network-based architectures. The results show that transfer learning helps researchers in developing a more accurate system for the early diagnosis of AD. However, there is a need to consider some points in future research, such as improving the accuracy of the prognostic prediction of AD, exploring additional biomarkers such as tau-PET and amyloid-PET to understand highly discriminative feature representation to separate similar brain patterns, managing the size of the datasets due to the limited availability.","systematic review","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","1","10.3390/s21217259","https://consensus.app/papers/transfer-learning-alzheimer-disease-neuroimaging-agarwal/862c75a340a7540b876fc97d6be79671/"
"Transfer Learning With Intelligent Training Data Selection for Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease","Transfer learning with intelligent training data selection, using pre-trained weights from natural images, can improve Alzheimer's disease detection from neuroimaging data, with a 4% and 7% increase in accuracy.","N. Khan, Nabila Abraham, Marcia Hon",2019,95,"Detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from neuroimaging data such as MRI through machine learning has been a subject of intense research in recent years. The recent success of deep learning in computer vision has progressed such research. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and the requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer learning, where the state-of-the-art VGG architecture is initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural images. The network is then fine-tuned with layer-wise tuning, where only a pre-defined group of layers are trained on MRI images. To shrink the training data size, we employ image entropy to select the most informative slices. Through experimentation on the ADNI dataset, we show that with the training size of 10 to 20 times smaller than the other contemporary methods, we reach the state-of-the-art performance in AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. NC classification problems, with a 4% and a 7% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art for AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC, respectively. We also provide a detailed analysis of the effect of the intelligent training data selection method, changing the training size, and changing the number of layers to be fine-tuned. Finally, we provide class activation maps (CAM) that demonstrate how the proposed model focuses on discriminative image regions that are neuropathologically relevant and can help the healthcare practitioner in interpreting the model’s decision-making process.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920448","https://consensus.app/papers/transfer-learning-with-intelligent-training-data-khan/28e8d4ec3a53521bb00539c557895855/"

The disease can be divided into five stages: Subjective Memory Concern (SMC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Alzheimer’s disease is conventionally diagnosed using an MRI scan of the brain. In this research, we propose a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier called AlzheimerNet, which can identify all five stages of Alzheimer’s disease and the Normal Control (NC) class. The ADNI database’s MRI scan dataset is obtained for use in training and testing the proposed model. To prepare the raw data for analysis, we applied the CLAHE image enhancement method. Data augmentation was used to remedy the unbalanced nature of the dataset and the resultant dataset consisted of 60000 image data on the 6 classes. Initially, five existing models including VGG16, MobileNetV2, AlexNet, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 were trained and tested to achieve test accuracies of 78.84%, 86.85%, 78.87%, 80.98% and 96.31% respectively.
