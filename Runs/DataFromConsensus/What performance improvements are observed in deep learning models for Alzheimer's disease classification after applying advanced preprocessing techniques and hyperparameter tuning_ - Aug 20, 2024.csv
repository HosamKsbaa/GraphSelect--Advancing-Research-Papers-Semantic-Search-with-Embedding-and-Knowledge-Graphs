"Hyperparameter Tuning with High Performance Computing Machine Learning for Imbalanced Alzheimer’s Disease Data","High-performance computing and a single-node multicore parallel structure significantly reduce computational time and improve cross-validation performance for imbalanced Alzheimer's disease data.","Fan Zhang, Melissa E. Petersen, L. Johnson, J. Hall, S. O'Bryant",2022,7,"Accurate detection is still a challenge in machine learning (ML) for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Class imbalance in imbalanced AD data is another big challenge for machine-learning algorithms working under the assumption that the data are evenly distributed within classes. Here, we present a hyperparameter tuning workflow with high-performance computing (HPC) for imbalanced data related to prevalent mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD) project. We applied a single-node multicore parallel mode to hyperparameter tuning of gamma, cost, and class weight using a support vector machine (SVM) model with 10 times repeated fivefold cross-validation. We executed the hyperparameter tuning workflow with R’s bigmemory, foreach, and doParallel packages on Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)’s Lonestar6 system. The computational time was dramatically reduced by up to 98.2% for the high-performance SVM hyperparameter tuning model, and the performance of cross-validation was also improved (the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value at base rate 12% were, respectively, 16.42% and 92.72%). Our results show that a single-node multicore parallel structure and high-performance SVM hyperparameter tuning model can deliver efficient and fast computation and achieve outstanding agility, simplicity, and productivity for imbalanced data in AD applications.","","Applied sciences (Basel, Switzerland)","2","10.3390/app12136670","https://consensus.app/papers/hyperparameter-tuning-high-performance-computing-zhang/b3e9084f65b355d0b55c7eeef54e60f9/"
"Stacked Deep Dense Neural Network Model to Predict Alzheimer’s Dementia Using Audio Transcript Data","The proposed Stacked Deep Dense Neural Network model significantly improves Alzheimer's dementia classification accuracy to 93.31% when applied with Glove embedding and hyperparameter tuning.","Yusera Farooq Khan, B. Kaushik, Mohammad Khalid Imam Rahmani, Md. Ezaz Ahmed",2022,10,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is caused by cortical degeneration leading to memory loss and dementia. A possible criterion for the early identification of Alzheimer’s dementia is to identify the difference between positive and negative linguistic and cognitive abilities of the patients. This study involves the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), designed a hybrid model with CNN & Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bidirectional LSTM), and proposed a Stacked Deep Dense Neural Network (SDDNN) model for text classification and prediction of Alzheimer’s dementia. These models were trained end-to-end using DementiaBank clinical transcript dataset. The transcripts consisted of recorded interviews of Alzheimer’s patients with clinical experts. The models were investigated under two settings: Randomly initialized and Glove embedding. Further, hyperparameter optimization was accomplished using GridSearch, which yielded optimal parameters for the design of suitable learning models for most accurate predictions. Other parameters were computed and compared based on AUC, accuracy, specificity, precision, F1 score, and recall. To ensure performance generalization, the classification accuracy was tested using 10-fold cross-validation approach. The performance and classification accuracy of the proposed model was significantly improved to 93.31% when applied with Glove embedding and hyperparameter tuning. This research work will considerably help the clinical experts in early detection and diagnosis of AD.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3161749","https://consensus.app/papers/stacked-dense-neural-network-model-predict-alzheimer-khan/4533e6994dd550fd9d8a791f039e22cd/"
"Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using Gaussian-Based Bayesian Parameter Optimization for Deep Convolutional LSTM Network","Bayesian optimization and long short-term memory (LSTM) in convolutional neural networks can improve early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis by optimizing hyperparameters and reducing experimentation time.","Monika Sethi, S. Ahuja, Shalli Rani, Puneet Bawa, Atef Zaguia",2021,18,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most important causes of mortality in elderly people, and it is often challenging to use traditional manual procedures when diagnosing a disease in the early stages. The successful implementation of machine learning (ML) techniques has also shown their effectiveness and its reliability as one of the better options for an early diagnosis of AD. But the heterogeneous dimensions and composition of the disease data have undoubtedly made diagnostics more difficult, needing a sufficient model choice to overcome the difficulty. Therefore, in this paper, four different 2D and 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks based on Bayesian search optimization are proposed to develop an optimized deep learning model to predict the early onset of AD binary and ternary classification on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Moreover, certain hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizers, and hidden units are to be set and adjusted for the performance boosting of the deep learning model. Bayesian optimization enables to leverage advantage throughout the experiments: A persistent hyperparameter space testing provides not only the output but also about the nearest conclusions. In this way, the series of experiments needed to explore space can be substantially reduced. Finally, alongside the use of Bayesian approaches, long short-term memory (LSTM) through the process of augmentation has resulted in finding the better settings of the model that too in less iterations with an relative improvement (RI) of 7.03%, 12.19%, 10.80%, and 11.99% over the four systems optimized with manual hyperparameters tuning such that hyperparameters that look more appealing from past data as well as the conventional techniques of manual selection.","","Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine","2","10.1155/2021/4186666","https://consensus.app/papers/classification-alzheimers-disease-using-gaussianbased-sethi/9834b187ba38502e85eaa42e388538ea/"
"A3C-TL-GTO: Alzheimer Automatic Accurate Classification Using Transfer Learning and Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer","The A3C-TL-GTO framework accurately classifies Alzheimer's patients using MRI images, providing a significant advantage for patient care and early diagnosis.","Nadiah A. Baghdadi, Amer Malki, H. M. Balaha, M. Badawy, Mostafa A. Elhosseini",2022,9,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic disease that affects the elderly. There are many different types of dementia, but Alzheimer’s disease is one of the leading causes of death. AD is a chronic brain disorder that leads to problems with language, disorientation, mood swings, bodily functions, memory loss, cognitive decline, mood or personality changes, and ultimately death due to dementia. Unfortunately, no cure has yet been developed for it, and it has no known causes. Clinically, imaging tools can aid in the diagnosis, and deep learning has recently emerged as an important component of these tools. Deep learning requires little or no image preprocessing and can infer an optimal data representation from raw images without prior feature selection. As a result, they produce a more objective and less biased process. The performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is primarily affected by the hyperparameters chosen and the dataset used. A deep learning model for classifying Alzheimer’s patients has been developed using transfer learning and optimized by Gorilla Troops for early diagnosis. This study proposes the A3C-TL-GTO framework for MRI image classification and AD detection. The A3C-TL-GTO is an empirical quantitative framework for accurate and automatic AD classification, developed and evaluated with the Alzheimer’s Dataset (four classes of images) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The proposed framework reduces the bias and variability of preprocessing steps and hyperparameters optimization to the classifier model and dataset used. Our strategy, evaluated on MRIs, is easily adaptable to other imaging methods. According to our findings, the proposed framework was an excellent instrument for this task, with a significant potential advantage for patient care. The ADNI dataset, an online dataset on Alzheimer’s disease, was used to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MR) brain images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 96.65% accuracy for the Alzheimer’s Dataset and 96.25% accuracy for the ADNI dataset. Moreover, a better performance in terms of accuracy is demonstrated over other state-of-the-art approaches.","","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","1","10.3390/s22114250","https://consensus.app/papers/a3ctlgto-alzheimer-automatic-accurate-classification-baghdadi/d835fb3a4c585ae9b8e592b1726e5969/"
"Deep Learning in Alzheimer's Disease: Diagnostic Classification and Prognostic Prediction Using Neuroimaging Data","Deep learning approaches show promise for diagnostic classification of Alzheimer's disease using multimodal neuroimaging data, with the best performance achieved when combining multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers.","T. Jo, K. Nho, A. Saykin",2019,352,"Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as—omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.","systematic review","Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience","1","10.3389/fnagi.2019.00220","https://consensus.app/papers/deep-learning-alzheimers-disease-diagnostic-jo/c09b595ff18b50feadfdb073214e1779/"
"A Tensorized Multitask Deep Learning Network for Progression Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease","The KTMnet deep neural network effectively performs multiclass classification and longitudinal regression simultaneously, enhancing the efficacy of both tasks for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and prediction.","Solale Tabarestani, M. Eslami, M. Cabrerizo, R. Curiel, A. Barreto, N. Rishe, David E Vaillancourt, S. DeKosky, D. Loewenstein, R. Duara, M. Adjouadi",2022,2,"With the advances in machine learning for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), most studies have focused on either identifying the subject’s status through classification algorithms or on predicting their cognitive scores through regression methods, neglecting the potential association between these two tasks. Motivated by the need to enhance the prospects for early diagnosis along with the ability to predict future disease states, this study proposes a deep neural network based on modality fusion, kernelization, and tensorization that perform multiclass classification and longitudinal regression simultaneously within a unified multitask framework. This relationship between multiclass classification and longitudinal regression is found to boost the efficacy of the final model in dealing with both tasks. Different multimodality scenarios are investigated, and complementary aspects of the multimodal features are exploited to simultaneously delineate the subject’s label and predict related cognitive scores at future timepoints using baseline data. The main intent in this multitask framework is to consolidate the highest accuracy possible in terms of precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) in the multiclass classification task while maintaining the highest similarity in the MMSE score as measured through the correlation coefficient and the RMSE for all time points under the prediction task, with both tasks, run simultaneously under the same set of hyperparameters. The overall accuracy for multiclass classification of the proposed KTMnet method is 66.85 ± 3.77. The prediction results show an average RMSE of 2.32 ± 0.52 and a correlation of 0.71 ± 5.98 for predicting MMSE throughout the time points. These results are compared to state-of-the-art techniques reported in the literature. A discovery from the multitasking of this consolidated machine learning framework is that a set of hyperparameters that optimize the prediction results may not necessarily be the same as those that would optimize the multiclass classification. In other words, there is a breakpoint beyond which enhancing further the results of one process could lead to the downgrading in accuracy for the other.","","Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience","1","10.3389/fnagi.2022.810873","https://consensus.app/papers/tensorized-multitask-deep-learning-network-progression-tabarestani/c5c3223ae6425bda86bb71d5ae2aead1/"
"AlzheimerNet: An Effective Deep Learning Based Proposition for Alzheimer’s Disease Stages Classification From Functional Brain Changes in Magnetic Resonance Images","The AlzheimerNet model effectively classifies Alzheimer's disease stages from brain MRI, outperforming traditional methods with a significance of 0.05.","F M Javed Mehedi Shamrat, Shamima Akter, S. Azam, Asif Karim, Pronab Ghosh, Zarrin Tasnim, Khan Md Hasib, F. De Boer, Kawsar Ahmed",2023,15,"Alzheimer’s disease is largely the underlying cause of dementia due to its progressive neurodegenerative nature among the elderly. The disease can be divided into five stages: Subjective Memory Concern (SMC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Alzheimer’s disease is conventionally diagnosed using an MRI scan of the brain. In this research, we propose a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier called AlzheimerNet, which can identify all five stages of Alzheimer’s disease and the Normal Control (NC) class. The ADNI database’s MRI scan dataset is obtained for use in training and testing the proposed model. To prepare the raw data for analysis, we applied the CLAHE image enhancement method. Data augmentation was used to remedy the unbalanced nature of the dataset and the resultant dataset consisted of 60000 image data on the 6 classes. Initially, five existing models including VGG16, MobileNetV2, AlexNet, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 were trained and tested to achieve test accuracies of 78.84%, 86.85%, 78.87%, 80.98% and 96.31% respectively. Since InceptionV3 provides the highest accuracy, this model is later modified to design the AlzheimerNet using RMSprop optimizer and learning rate 0.00001 to achieve the highest test accuracy of 98.67%. The five pre-trained models and the proposed fine-tuned model were compared in terms of various performance matrices to demonstrate whether the AlzheimerNet model is in fact performing better in classifying and detecting the six classes. An ablation study shows the hyperparameters used in the experiment. The suggested model outperforms the traditional methods for classifying Alzheimer’s disease stages from brain MRI, as measured by a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with a significance of <0.05.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3244952","https://consensus.app/papers/alzheimernet-effective-deep-learning-based-proposition-shamrat/49e5c820ab8f549f80e46739db681a63/"
"A Comprehensive Study of Alzheimer's Disease Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks","Most popular convolutional neural network models for Alzheimer's disease classification from brain MRI scans perform similarly, with 3D models improving accuracy by 1% and pre-training yielding minimal improvement.","Ziqiang Guan, Ritesh Kumar, Y. Fung, Y. Wu, M. Fiterau",2019,13,"A plethora of deep learning models have been developed for the task of Alzheimer's disease classification from brain MRI scans. Many of these models report high performance, achieving three-class classification accuracy of up to 95%. However, it is common for these studies to draw performance comparisons between models that are trained on different subsets of a dataset or use varying imaging preprocessing techniques, making it difficult to objectively assess model performance. Furthermore, many of these works do not provide details such as hyperparameters, the specific MRI scans used, or their source code, making it difficult to replicate their experiments. To address these concerns, we present a comprehensive study of some of the deep learning methods and architectures on the full set of images available from ADNI. We find that, (1) classification using 3D models gives an improvement of 1% in our setup, at the cost of significantly longer training time and more computation power, (2) with our dataset, pre-training yields minimal ($<0.5\%$) improvement in model performance, (3) most popular convolutional neural network models yield similar performance when compared to each other. Lastly, we briefly compare the effects of two image preprocessing programs: FreeSurfer and Clinica, and find that the spatially normalized and segmented outputs from Clinica increased the accuracy of model prediction from 63% to 89% when compared to FreeSurfer images.","","ArXiv","","","https://consensus.app/papers/comprehensive-study-alzheimers-disease-classification-guan/7a96702138ee5b5a84013400dd11216d/"
