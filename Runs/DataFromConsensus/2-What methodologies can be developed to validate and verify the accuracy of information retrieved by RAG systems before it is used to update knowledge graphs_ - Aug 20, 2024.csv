"RAGAT: Relation Aware Graph Attention Network for Knowledge Graph Completion","RAGAT outperforms existing models in knowledge graph completion by incorporating relation-specific parameters and message functions, enhancing the expressive capability of message functions.","Xiyang Liu, Huobin Tan, Qinghong Chen, Guangyan Lin",2021,25,"Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is the task of predicting missing links based on known triples for knowledge graphs. Several recent works suggest that Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that exploit graph structures achieve promising performance on KGC. These models learn information called messages from neighboring entities and relations and then aggregate messages to update central entity representations. The drawback of existing GNN based models lies in that they tend to treat relations equally and learn fixed network parameters, overlooking the distinction of each relational information. In this work, we propose a Relation Aware Graph ATtention network (RAGAT) that constructs separate message functions for different relations, which aims at exploiting the heterogeneous characteristics of knowledge graphs. Specifically, we introduce relation specific parameters to augment the expressive capability of message functions, which enables the model to extract relational information in parameter space. To validate the effect of relation aware mechanism, RAGAT is implemented with a variety of relation aware message functions. Experiments show RAGAT outperforms state-of-the-art link prediction baselines on standard FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055529","https://consensus.app/papers/ragat-relation-aware-graph-attention-network-knowledge-liu/be9e9a750d2a556b8da76162008c613d/"
"Knowledge Verification From Data.","The proposed knowledge verification method, which utilizes correlation and causality from numerical data, accurately evaluates knowledge quality and has strong robustness to noise in data.","Xiangyu Wang, Taiyu Ban, Lyuzhou Chen, Xingyu Wu, Derui Lyu, Huanhuan Chen",2022,5,"Knowledge verification is an important task in the quality management of knowledge graphs (KGs). Knowledge is a summary of facts and events based on human cognition and experience. Due to the nature of knowledge, most knowledge quality (KQ) management methods are designed by human experts or the characteristics of existing knowledge, which may be limited by human cognition and the quality of existing knowledge. Numerical data contain a wealth of potential information that may be helpful in verifying knowledge, which is rarely explored. However, due to the implicit representation of numerical data to facts as well as the noise in the data, it is challenging to use data to verify the knowledge. Therefore, this article proposes a knowledge verification method, which discovers the correlation and causality from numerical data to validate knowledge and then evaluate the quality of knowledge. Moreover, to address the impact of noise, the method integrates multisource knowledge to jointly evaluate the KQ. Specifically, an iterative update method is designed to update KQ by utilizing the consistency between multisource knowledge while designing knowledge verification factors based on data causality and correlation to manage update process. The method is validated with multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method could evaluate KQ more accurately and has strong robustness to noise in the data.","","IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems","1","10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3202244","https://consensus.app/papers/knowledge-verification-from-data-wang/13f7c18ace295e6f917a153a3643372d/"
"RAG: An update to the RNA-As-Graphs resource","The updated RNA-As-Graphs resource enhances the search for novel RNA functionality by classifying existing motifs, suggesting new motifs, and allowing more specific searches for specific topologies.","Joseph A. Izzo, N. Kim, Shereef Elmetwaly, Tamar Schlick",2011,98,"BackgroundIn 2004, we presented a web resource for stimulating the search for novel RNAs, RNA-As-Graphs (RAG), which classified, catalogued, and predicted RNA secondary structure motifs using clustering and build-up approaches. With the increased availability of secondary structures in recent years, we update the RAG resource and provide various improvements for analyzing RNA structures.DescriptionOur RAG update includes a new supervised clustering algorithm that can suggest RNA motifs that may be ""RNA-like"". We use this utility to describe RNA motifs as three classes: existing, RNA-like, and non-RNA-like. This produces 126 tree and 16,658 dual graphs as candidate RNA-like topologies using the supervised clustering algorithm with existing RNAs serving as the training data. A comparison of this clustering approach to an earlier method shows considerable improvements. Additional RAG features include greatly expanded search capabilities, an interface to better utilize the benefits of relational database, and improvements to several of the utilities such as directed/labeled graphs and a subgraph search program.ConclusionsThe RAG updates presented here augment the database's intended function - stimulating the search for novel RNA functionality - by classifying available motifs, suggesting new motifs for design, and allowing for more specific searches for specific topologies. The updated RAG web resource offers users a graph-based tool for exploring available RNA motifs and suggesting new RNAs for design.","","BMC Bioinformatics","1","10.1186/1471-2105-12-219","https://consensus.app/papers/rnaasgraphs-resource-izzo/a38df00d516d51478ae34f7815e5c693/"

"Knowledge Graphs: An Information Retrieval Perspective","Knowledge graphs can enhance information retrieval tasks and can be constructed and completed using language technology, offering potential for future research and development.","Ridho Reinanda, E. Meij, M. de Rijke",2020,51,"In this survey, we provide an overview of the literature on knowledge graphs (KGs) in the context of information retrieval (IR). Modern IR systems can benefit from information available in KGs in multiple ways, independent of whether the KGs are publicly available or proprietary ones. We provide an overview of the components required when building IR systems that leverage KGs and use a task-oriented organization of the material that we discuss. As an understanding of the intersection of IR and KGs is beneficial to many researchers and practitioners, we consider prior work from two complementary angles: leveraging KGs for information retrieval and enriching KGs using IR techniques. We start by discussing how KGs can be employed to support IR tasks, including document and entity retrieval. We then proceed by describing how IR—and language technology in general—can be utilized for the construction and completion of KGs. This includes tasks such as entity recognition, typing, and relation extraction. We discuss common issues that appear across the tasks that we consider and identify future directions for addressing them. We also provide pointers to datasets and other resources that should be useful for both newcomers and experienced researchers in the area.

"Knowledge Graph Embedding for Link Prediction","Knowledge Graph embedding-based Link Prediction methods show promise in identifying missing facts in incomplete Knowledge Graphs, but design choices in these methods significantly impact their effectiveness and efficiency.","Andrea Rossi, D.

"Mobile Link Prediction: Automated Creation and Crowd-sourced Validation of Knowledge Graphs","The knowledge graph builder, combining automation, experts' and crowd-sourced citizens' knowledge, improves accuracy and scalability in cyber-physical social systems.","M. Ballandies, Evangelos Pournaras",2020,5,"Building trustworthy knowledge graphs for cyber-physical social systems (CPSS) is a challenge. In particular, current approaches relying on human experts have limited scalability, while automated approaches are often not accountable to users resulting in knowledge graphs of questionable quality. This paper introduces a novel pervasive knowledge graph builder that brings together automation, experts' and crowd-sourced citizens' knowledge. The knowledge graph grows via automated link predictions using genetic programming that are validated by humans for improving transparency and calibrating accuracy. The knowledge graph builder is designed for pervasive devices such as smartphones and preserves privacy by localizing all computations. The accuracy, practicality, and usability of the knowledge graph builder is evaluated in a real-world social experiment that involves a smartphone implementation and a Smart City application scenario. The proposed knowledge graph building methodology outperforms the baseline method in terms of accuracy while demonstrating its efficient calculations on smartphones and the feasibility of the pervasive human supervision process in terms of high interactions throughput. These findings promise new opportunities to crowd-source and operate pervasive reasoning systems for cyber-physical social systems in Smart Cities.","","Microprocess.

"Extraction of Validating Shapes from very large Knowledge Graphs","The Quality Shapes Extraction (QSE) approach effectively extracts validating shapes from large Knowledge Graphs, reducing extraction time and reducing the number of constraints presented to the user.","Kashif Rabbani, Matteo Lissandrini, K. Hose",2023,6,"
 Knowledge Graphs (KGs) represent heterogeneous domain knowledge on the Web and within organizations. There exist shapes constraint languages to define
 validating shapes
 to ensure the quality of the data in KGs. Existing techniques to extract validating shapes often fail to extract complete shapes, are not scalable, and are prone to produce spurious shapes. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Quality Shapes Extraction (QSE) approach to extract validating shapes in very large graphs, for which we devise both an exact and an approximate solution. QSE provides information about the reliability of shape constraints by computing their confidence and support within a KG and in doing so allows to identify shapes that are most informative and less likely to be affected by incomplete or incorrect data. To the best of our knowledge, QSE is the first approach to extract a complete set of validating shapes from WikiData. Moreover, QSE provides a 12x reduction in extraction time compared to existing approaches, while managing to filter out up to 93% of the invalid and spurious shapes, resulting in a reduction of up to 2 orders of magnitude in the number of constraints presented to the user, e.g., from 11,916 to 809 on DBpedia.

"Efficient Knowledge Graph Validation via Cross-Graph Representation Learning","CrossVal effectively validates large-scale knowledge graphs by leveraging external human-curated knowledge graphs and semantic embedding of triplets.","Yaqing Wang, Fenglong Ma, Jing Gao",2020,9,"Recent advances in information extraction have motivated the automatic construction of huge Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by mining from large-scale text corpus. However, noisy facts are unavoidably introduced into KGs that could be caused by automatic extraction. To validate the correctness of facts (i.e., triplets) inside a KG, one possible approach is to map the triplets into vector representations by capturing the semantic meanings of facts. Although many representation learning approaches have been developed for knowledge graphs, these methods are not effective for validation. They usually assume that facts are correct, and thus may overfit noisy facts and fail to detect such facts. Towards effective KG validation, we propose to leverage an external human-curated KG as auxiliary information source to help detect the errors in a target KG. The external KG is built upon human-curated knowledge repositories and tends to have high precision. On the other hand, although the target KG built by information extraction from texts has low precision, it can cover new or domain-specific facts that are not in any human-curated repositories. To leverage external KG for validation, one intuitive approach is to find matched triplets between the target KG and the external KG. However, this approach can only apply to the small portion of triplets that are covered by both external and target KGs and is not useful for the validation of majority of the triplets. To tackle this challenging task, we propose a cross-graph representation learning framework, i.e., CrossVal, which can leverage an external KG to validate the facts in the target KG efficiently. This is achieved by embedding triplets based on their semantic meanings, drawing cross-KG negative samples and estimating a confidence score for each triplet based on its degree of correctness. We evaluate the proposed framework on datasets across different domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale KGs.","","Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management","","10.1145/3340531.3411902","https://consensus.app/papers/efficient-knowledge-graph-validation-crossgraph-wang/d87ccac6905c5a26a4e91b4f35f12bb0/"
