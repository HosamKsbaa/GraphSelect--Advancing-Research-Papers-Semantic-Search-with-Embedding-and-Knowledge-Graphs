"Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Alzheimer's Disease: Overview and Reproducible Evaluation","Different 3D CNN approaches for Alzheimer's disease classification from brain imaging data perform similarly, but 2D slice approaches show lower performance.","Junhao Wen, Elina Thibeau-Sutre, J. Samper-González, A. Routier, Simona Bottani, S. Durrleman, Ninon Burgos, O. Colliot",2019,331,"Numerous machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from brain imaging data. In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics. All the code of the framework and the experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-DL.","systematic review","Medical image analysis","1","10.1016/j.media.2020.101694","https://consensus.app/papers/neural-networks-classification-alzheimers-disease-wen/f8b6675994ba54b3a71585ae12d20157/"
"AlzheimerNet: An Effective Deep Learning Based Proposition for Alzheimer’s Disease Stages Classification From Functional Brain Changes in Magnetic Resonance Images","The AlzheimerNet model effectively classifies Alzheimer's disease stages from brain MRI, outperforming traditional methods with a significance of 0.05.","F M Javed Mehedi Shamrat, Shamima Akter, S. Azam, Asif Karim, Pronab Ghosh, Zarrin Tasnim, Khan Md Hasib, F. De Boer, Kawsar Ahmed",2023,15,"Alzheimer’s disease is largely the underlying cause of dementia due to its progressive neurodegenerative nature among the elderly. The disease can be divided into five stages: Subjective Memory Concern (SMC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Alzheimer’s disease is conventionally diagnosed using an MRI scan of the brain. In this research, we propose a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier called AlzheimerNet, which can identify all five stages of Alzheimer’s disease and the Normal Control (NC) class. The ADNI database’s MRI scan dataset is obtained for use in training and testing the proposed model. To prepare the raw data for analysis, we applied the CLAHE image enhancement method. Data augmentation was used to remedy the unbalanced nature of the dataset and the resultant dataset consisted of 60000 image data on the 6 classes. Initially, five existing models including VGG16, MobileNetV2, AlexNet, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 were trained and tested to achieve test accuracies of 78.84%, 86.85%, 78.87%, 80.98% and 96.31% respectively. Since InceptionV3 provides the highest accuracy, this model is later modified to design the AlzheimerNet using RMSprop optimizer and learning rate 0.00001 to achieve the highest test accuracy of 98.67%. The five pre-trained models and the proposed fine-tuned model were compared in terms of various performance matrices to demonstrate whether the AlzheimerNet model is in fact performing better in classifying and detecting the six classes. An ablation study shows the hyperparameters used in the experiment. The suggested model outperforms the traditional methods for classifying Alzheimer’s disease stages from brain MRI, as measured by a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with a significance of <0.05.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3244952","https://consensus.app/papers/alzheimernet-effective-deep-learning-based-proposition-shamrat/49e5c820ab8f549f80e46739db681a63/"
"Random Forest Algorithm for the Classification of Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review","Random Forest algorithm, applied on multi-modal neuroimaging data, produces one of the best accuracies for predicting Alzheimer's disease conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment, with advantages in robustness, non-linear data handling, and parallel processing.","A. Sarica, A. Cerasa, A. Quattrone",2017,342,"Objective: Machine learning classification has been the most important computational development in the last years to satisfy the primary need of clinicians for automatic early diagnosis and prognosis. Nowadays, Random Forest (RF) algorithm has been successfully applied for reducing high dimensional and multi-source data in many scientific realms. Our aim was to explore the state of the art of the application of RF on single and multi-modal neuroimaging data for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted on this field of study. In particular, we constructed an advanced query using boolean operators as follows: (“random forest” OR “random forests”) AND neuroimaging AND (“alzheimer's disease” OR alzheimer's OR alzheimer) AND (prediction OR classification). The query was then searched in four well-known scientific databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Results: Twelve articles—published between the 2007 and 2017—have been included in this systematic review after a quantitative and qualitative selection. The lesson learnt from these works suggest that when RF was applied on multi-modal data for prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) conversion from the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), it produces one of the best accuracies to date. Moreover, the RF has important advantages in terms of robustness to overfitting, ability to handle highly non-linear data, stability in the presence of outliers and opportunity for efficient parallel processing mainly when applied on multi-modality neuroimaging data, such as, MRI morphometric, diffusion tensor imaging, and PET images. Conclusions: We discussed the strengths of RF, considering also possible limitations and by encouraging further studies on the comparisons of this algorithm with other commonly used classification approaches, particularly in the early prediction of the progression from MCI to AD.","systematic review","Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience","1","10.3389/fnagi.2017.00329","https://consensus.app/papers/random-forest-algorithm-classification-neuroimaging-sarica/b9c5a761912d5c448f074cb98a9b551c/"
"Machine learning methods for predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease dementia: a systematic review","Machine learning methods using neuroimaging data show promise in predicting Alzheimer's disease dementia progression in patients with mild cognitive impairment.","Sergio Grueso, R. Viejo-Sobera",2021,60,"Background An increase in lifespan in our society is a double-edged sword that entails a growing number of patients with neurocognitive disorders, Alzheimer’s disease being the most prevalent. Advances in medical imaging and computational power enable new methods for the early detection of neurocognitive disorders with the goal of preventing or reducing cognitive decline. Computer-aided image analysis and early detection of changes in cognition is a promising approach for patients with mild cognitive impairment, sometimes a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Methods We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines of studies where machine learning was applied to neuroimaging data in order to predict whether patients with mild cognitive impairment might develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or remain stable. After removing duplicates, we screened 452 studies and selected 116 for qualitative analysis. Results Most studies used magnetic resonance image (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data but also magnetoencephalography. The datasets were mainly extracted from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database with some exceptions. Regarding the algorithms used, the most common was support vector machine with a mean accuracy of 75.4%, but convolutional neural networks achieved a higher mean accuracy of 78.5%. Studies combining MRI and PET achieved overall better classification accuracy than studies that only used one neuroimaging technique. In general, the more complex models such as those based on deep learning, combined with multimodal and multidimensional data (neuroimaging, clinical, cognitive, genetic, and behavioral) achieved the best performance. Conclusions Although the performance of the different methods still has room for improvement, the results are promising and this methodology has a great potential as a support tool for clinicians and healthcare professionals.","systematic review","Alzheimer's Research & Therapy","1","10.1186/s13195-021-00900-w","https://consensus.app/papers/machine-learning-methods-predicting-progression-mild-grueso/6f318c71609c5740a7130c3c586d3a82/"
"A practical Alzheimer’s disease classifier via brain imaging-based deep learning on 85,721 samples","The proposed Alzheimer's disease classifier using deep learning on 85,721 MRI scans achieved 94.9% accuracy, offering a medical-grade biomarker for integrated diagnostic practice.","Bin Lu, Hui-Xian Li, Zhi-Kai Chang, Le Li, Ning-Xuan Chen, Zhi-Chen Zhu, Hui Zhou, Xue-Ying Li, Yu-Wei Wang, Shiyao Cui, Z. Deng, Zhen Fan, Hong Yang, Xiao Chen, Paul M. Thompson, F. Castellanos, Chaogan Yan",2022,35,"Beyond detecting brain lesions or tumors, comparatively little success has been attained in identifying brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many machine learning algorithms to detect AD have been trained using limited training data, meaning they often generalize poorly when applied to scans from previously unseen populations. Here we aimed to build a practical brain imaging-based AD diagnostic classifier using deep learning/transfer learning on dataset of unprecedented size and diversity. We pooled MRI data from more than 217 sites/scanners to constitute the largest brain MRI sample to date (85,721 scans from 50,876 participants). Next, we applied a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, Inception-ResNet-V2, to build a sex classifier with high generalization capability. The sex classifier achieved 94.9% accuracy and served as a base model in transfer learning for the objective diagnosis of AD. After transfer learning, the model fine-tuned for AD classification achieved 91.3% accuracy in leave-sites-out cross-validation on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and 94.2%/87.9% accuracy for direct tests on two unseen independent datasets (AIBL/OASIS). When this AD classifier was tested on brain images from unseen mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, MCI patients who finally converted to AD were 3 times more likely to be predicted as AD than MCI patients who did not convert (65.2% vs 20.6%). Predicted scores from the AD classifier showed significant correlations with illness severity. In sum, the proposed AD classifier could offer a medical-grade biomarker that could be integrated into AD diagnostic practice. Our trained model, code and preprocessed data are freely available to the research community.","","Journal of Big Data","1","10.1186/s40537-022-00650-y","https://consensus.app/papers/alzheimer-disease-classifier-brain-learning-85721-lu/21a6d7aeed065281993c2f5783a2269f/"

The fusion of multiple data modalities can provide a holistic view of AD staging analysis. Thus, we use deep learning (DL) to integrally analyze imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), and clinical test data to classify patients into AD, MCI, and controls (CN). We use stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis. Using Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, we demonstrate that deep models outperform shallow models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating multi-modality data outperforms single modality models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and meanF1 scores. Our models have identified hippocampus, amygdala brain areas, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) as top distinguished features, which are consistent with the known AD literature.","","Scientific Reports","1","10.1038/s41598-020-74399-w","https://consensus.app/papers/multimodal-learning-models-detection-alzheimer-disease-venugopalan/0f1cc4babfda53d1a5f622c960d0071e/"
"An Intelligent System for Early Recognition of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Neuroimaging","Advanced deep learning with MRI images can effectively identify early Alzheimer's disease symptoms with 98.86% accuracy, 98.94% precision, and 98.89% recall.","M. Odusami, R. Maskeliūnas, R.

Early detection of MCI can be used to save patient brain cells from further damage and direct additional medical treatment to prevent its progression. Lately, the use of deep learning for the early identification of AD has generated a lot of interest. However, one of the limitations of such algorithms is their inability to identify changes in the functional connectivity in the functional brain network of patients with MCI. In this paper, we attempt to elucidate this issue with randomized concatenated deep features obtained from two pre-trained models, which simultaneously learn deep features from brain functional networks from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. We experimented with ResNet18 and DenseNet201 to perform the task of AD multiclass classification. A gradient class activation map was used to mark the discriminating region of the image for the proposed model prediction. Accuracy, precision, and recall were used to assess the performance of the proposed system. The experimental analysis showed that the proposed model was able to achieve 98.86% accuracy, 98.94% precision, and 98.89% recall in multiclass classification.

"Multi-class Alzheimer's disease classification using image and clinical features","The proposed Alzheimer's disease detection and classification algorithm, using image and clinical features, achieves a 79.8% accuracy in multi-class classification of AD, normal, and MCI.","T. Altaf, S. Anwar, Nadia Gul, M. N. Majeed, Muhammad Majid",2018,95,"Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which results in memory related issues in subjects. An accurate detection and classification of AD alongside its prodromal stage i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is of great clinical importance. In this paper, an Alzheimer detection and classification algorithm is presented. The bag of visual word approach is used to improve the effectiveness of texture based features, such as gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), scale invariant feature transform, local binary pattern and histogram of gradient. The importance of clinical data provided alongside the imaging data is highlighted by incorporating clinical features with texture based features to generate a hybrid feature vector. The features are extracted from whole as well as segmented regions of magnetic resonance (MR) brain images representing grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The proposed algorithm is validated using the Alzheimer's disease neuro-imaging initiative dataset (ADNI), where images are classified into one of the three classes namely, AD, normal, and MCI. The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in key evaluation parameters including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. An accuracy of 98.4% is achieved for binary classification of AD and normal class. For multi-class classification of AD, normal and MCI, an accuracy of 79.8% is achieved.","","Biomed. Signal Process.

It steadily worsens from mild to severe, impairing one’s ability to complete any work without assistance. It begins to outstrip due to the population ages and diagnosis timeline. For classifying cases, existing approaches incorporate medical history, neuropsychological testing, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), but efficient procedures remain inconsistent due to lack of sensitivity and precision. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to create a framework that can be used to detect specific Alzheimer’s disease characteristics from MRI images. By considering four stages of dementia and conducting a particular diagnosis, the proposed model generates high-resolution disease probability maps from the local brain structure to a multilayer perceptron and provides accurate, intuitive visualizations of individual Alzheimer’s disease risk. To avoid the problem of class imbalance, the samples should be evenly distributed among the classes. The obtained MRI image dataset from Kaggle has a major class imbalance problem. A DEMentia NETwork (DEMNET) is proposed to detect the dementia stages from MRI. The DEMNET achieves an accuracy of 95.23%, Area Under Curve (AUC) of 97% and Cohen’s Kappa value of 0.93 from the Kaggle dataset, which is superior to existing methods.

Gao",2022,4,"To improve the diagnosis and classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a modeling method is proposed based on the combining magnetic resonance images (MRI) brain structural data with metabolite levels of the frontal and parietal regions. First, multi-atlas brain segmentation technology based on T1-weighted images and edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were used to extract data of 279 brain regions and levels of 12 metabolites from regions of interest (ROIs) in the frontal and parietal regions. The t-test combined with false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used to reduce the dimensionality in the data, and MRI structural data of 54 brain regions and levels of 4 metabolites that obviously correlated with AD were screened out. Lastly, the stacked auto-encoder neural network (SAE) was used to classify AD and healthy controls (HCs), which judged the effect of classification method by fivefold cross validation. The results indicated that the mean accuracy of the five experimental model increased from 96 to 100%, the AUC value increased from 0.97 to 1, specificity increased from 90 to 100%, and F1 value increased from 0.97 to 1. Comparing the effect of each metabolite on model performance revealed that the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) + levels in the parietal region resulted in the most significant improvement in model performance, with the accuracy rate increasing from 96 to 98%, the AUC value increased from 0.97 to 0.99 and the specificity increasing from 90 to 95%. Moreover, the GABA + levels in the parietal region was significantly correlated with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of patients with AD (r = 0.627), and the F statistics were largest (F = 25.538), which supports the hypothesis that dysfunctional GABAergic system play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Overall, our findings support that a comprehensive method that combines MRI structural and metabolic data of brain regions can improve model classification efficiency of AD.","","Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience","1","10.3389/fnagi.2022.927217","https://consensus.app/papers/classification-alzheimer-disease-based-deep-learning-wang/327afbe9841e585ea66ef023f170863d/"
