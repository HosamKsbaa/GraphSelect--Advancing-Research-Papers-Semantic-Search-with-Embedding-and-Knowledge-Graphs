"Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Alzheimer's Disease: Overview and Reproducible Evaluation","Different 3D CNN approaches for Alzheimer's disease classification from brain imaging data perform similarly, but 2D slice approaches show lower performance.","Junhao Wen, Elina Thibeau-Sutre, J. Samper-González, A. Routier, Simona Bottani, S. Durrleman, Ninon Burgos, O. Colliot",2019,331,"Numerous machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from brain imaging data. In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics. All the code of the framework and the experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-DL.","systematic review","Medical image analysis","1","10.1016/j.media.2020.101694","https://consensus.app/papers/neural-networks-classification-alzheimers-disease-wen/f8b6675994ba54b3a71585ae12d20157/"

"Multi-model and multi-slice ensemble learning architecture based on 2D convolutional neural networks for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis","The proposed ensemble learning architecture based on 2D CNNs provides an effective, accurate, and automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, even with limited neuroimaging data.","Wenjie Kang, Lan Lin, Baiwen Zhang, Xiaoqi Shen, Shuicai Wu",2021,52,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease without effective medications or supplemental treatments. Thus, predicting AD progression is crucial for clinical practice and medical research. Due to limited neuroimaging data, two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D CNNs) have been commonly adopted to differentiate among cognitively normal subjects (CN), people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients. Therefore, this paper proposes an ensemble learning (EL) architecture based on 2D CNNs, using a multi-model and multi-slice ensemble. First, the top 11 coronal slices of grey matter density maps for AD versus CN classifications were selected. Second, the discriminator of a generative adversarial network, VGG16, and ResNet50 were trained with the selected slices, and the majority voting scheme was used to merge the multi-slice decisions of each model. Afterwards, those three classifiers were used to construct an ensemble model. Multi-slice ensemble learning was designed to obtain spatial features, while multi-model integration reduced the prediction error rate. Finally, transfer learning was used in domain adaptation to refine those CNNs, moving them from working solely with AD versus CN classifications to being applicable to other tasks. This ensemble approach achieved accuracy values of 90.36%, 77.19%, and 72.36% when classifying AD versus CN, AD versus MCI, and MCI versus CN, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art 2D studies, the proposed approach provides an effective, accurate, automatic diagnosis along the AD continuum. This technique may enhance AD diagnostics when the sample size is limited.","","Computers in biology and medicine","1","10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104678","https://consensus.app/papers/multimodel-multislice-learning-architecture-based-kang/690b29bb1e045a308316364de7ba0544/"

A customized Convolutional Neural Network with one processing module of convolution, Rectified Linear Units (ReLu) and pooling layer (CNN1) is designed to extract from PSD-images some suitable features and to perform the corresponding two and three-ways classification tasks. The resulting CNN is shown to provide better classification performance when compared to more conventional learning machines; indeed, it achieves an average accuracy of 89.8% in binary classification and of 83.3% in three-ways classification.

"Construction of MRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Score Based on Efficient 3D Convolutional Neural Network: Comprehensive Validation on 7,902 Images from a Multi-Center Dataset.","Our subject-level 3D CNN effectively classifies Alzheimer's disease from whole brain MRI images, with competitive performance and potential for generalization.","Evangeline Yee, Da Ma, K. Popuri, Lei Wang, M. Beg",2020,13,"BACKGROUND
In recent years, many convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proposed for the classification of Alzheimer's disease. Due to memory constraints, many of the proposed CNNs work at a 2D slice-level or 3D patch-level.


OBJECTIVE
Here, we propose a subject-level 3D CNN that can extract the neurodegenerative patterns of the whole brain MRI and converted into a probabilistic Dementia score.


METHODS
We propose an efficient and lightweight subject-level 3D CNN featuring dilated convolutions. We trained our network on the ADNI data on stable Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (sDAT) from stable normal controls (sNC). To comprehensively evaluate the generalizability of our proposed network, we performed four independent tests which includes testing on images from other ADNI individuals at various stages of the dementia, images acquired from other sites (AIBL), images acquired using different protocols (OASIS), and longitudinal images acquired over a short period of time (MIRIAD).


RESULTS
We achieved a 5-fold cross-validated balanced accuracy of 88%in differentiating sDAT from sNC, and an overall specificity of 79.5%and sensitivity 79.7%on the entire set of 7,902 independent test images.


CONCLUSION
Independent testing is essential for estimating the generalization ability of the network to unseen data, but is often lacking in studies using CNN for DAT classification. This makes it difficult to compare the performances achieved using different architectures. Our comprehensive evaluation highlighting the competitive performance of our network and potential promise for generalization.","","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","1","10.3233/jad-200830","https://consensus.app/papers/construction-mribased-alzheimers-disease-score-based-yee/6d96d94109c35330b8c32cf71c3cbbed/"
"Fine-Grained and Multiple Classification for Alzheimer's Disease With Wavelet Convolution Unit Network","The novel wavelet convolution unit network and diffuse tensor images achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in fine-grained Alzheimer's disease classifications, surpassing existing methods.","Jinyu Wen, Yang Li, Mei Fang, Lei Zhu, D. Feng, Ping Li",2023,1,"In this article, we propose a novel wavelet convolution unit for the image-oriented neural network to integrate wavelet analysis with a vanilla convolution operator to extract deep abstract features more efficiently. On one hand, in order to acquire non-local receptive fields and avoid information loss, we define a new convolution operation by composing a traditional convolution function and approximate and detailed representations after single-scale wavelet decomposition of source images. On the other hand, multi-scale wavelet decomposition is introduced to obtain more comprehensive multi-scale feature information. Then, we fuse all these cross-scale features to improve the problem of inaccurate localization of singular points. Given the novel wavelet convolution unit, we further design a network based on it for fine-grained Alzheimer's disease classifications (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, Normal controls, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment). Up to now, only a few methods have studied one or several fine-grained classifications, and even fewer methods can achieve both fine-grained and multi-class classifications. We adopt the novel network and diffuse tensor images to achieve fine-grained classifications, which achieved state-of-the-art accuracy for all eight kinds of fine-grained classifications, up to 97.30%, 95.78%, 95.00%, 94.00%, 97.89%, 95.71%, 95.07%, 93.79%. In order to build a reference standard for Alzheimer's disease classifications, we actually implemented all twelve coarse-grained and fine-grained classifications. The results show that the proposed method achieves solidly high accuracy for them. Its classification ability greatly exceeds any kind of existing Alzheimer's disease classification method.","","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","1","10.1109/TBME.2023.3256042","https://consensus.app/papers/finegrained-classification-alzheimers-disease-with-wen/c455f720d6b5562fb90060c53bd20afd/"
"A multi-model deep convolutional neural network for automatic hippocampus segmentation and classification in Alzheimer’s disease","The proposed multi-model deep learning framework using convolutional neural networks effectively segmented the hippocampus and accurately classified Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment using structural MRI data.","Manhua Liu, Fan Li, Hao Yan, Kundong Wang, Yixin Ma, L. Shen, Mingqing Xu",2019,255,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain degenerative disorder. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data collected from 97 AD, 233 MCI, 119 Normal Control (NC) subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The proposed method achieves a dice similarity coefficient of 87.0% for hippocampal segmentation. In addition, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.9% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.5% for classifying AD vs. NC subjects, and an accuracy of 76.2% and an AUC of 77.5% for classifying MCI vs. NC subjects. Our empirical study also demonstrates that the proposed multi-model method outperforms the single-model methods and several other competing methods.","","NeuroImage","1","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116459","https://consensus.app/papers/multimodel-network-hippocampus-segmentation-liu/9d65e63bb0695d6facc7dadc61e52901/"

The optimization framework, equipped with our ensemble generalization loss, was formulated and solved using the sequential quadratic programming. Through this method, we achieved optimal DCNN fusion weights (i.e., a high generalization performance).

"A 3D densely connected convolution neural network with connection-wise attention mechanism for Alzheimer's disease classification.","Our deep learning method, using a densely connected convolution neural network with connection-wise attention mechanism, effectively detects and predicts Alzheimer's disease in brain MR images.","Jiehui Zhang, Bowen Zheng, Ang Gao, Xingyuan Feng, Dong-Po Liang, Xiaojing Long",2021,69,"PURPOSE
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease. In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely used on analysis of neuroimage for quantitative evaluation and computer-aided diagnosis of AD or prediction on the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. In this study, we aimed to develop a new deep learning method to detect or predict AD in an efficient way.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We proposed a densely connected convolution neural network with connection-wise attention mechanism to learn the multi-level features of brain MR images for AD classification. We used the densely connected neural network to extract multi-scale features from pre-processed images, and connection-wise attention mechanism was applied to combine connections among features from different layers to hierarchically transform the MR images into more compact high-level features. Furthermore, we extended the convolution operation to 3D to capture the spatial information of MRI. The features extracted from each 3D convolution layer were integrated with features from all preceding layers with different attention, and were finally used for classification. Our method was evaluated on the baseline MRI of 968 subjects from ADNI database to discriminate (1) AD versus healthy subjects, (2) MCI converters versus healthy subjects, and (3) MCI converters versus non-converters.


RESULTS
The proposed method achieved 97.35% accuracy for distinguishing AD patients from healthy control, 87.82% for MCI converters against healthy control, and 78.79% for MCI converters against non-converters. Compared with some neural networks and methods reported in recent studies, the classification performance of our proposed algorithm was among the top ranks and improved in discriminating MCI subjects who were in high risks of conversion to AD.


CONCLUSIONS
Deep learning techniques provide a powerful tool to explore minute but intricate characteristics in MR images which may facilitate early diagnosis and prediction of AD.","","Magnetic resonance imaging","2","10.1016/j.mri.2021.02.001","https://consensus.app/papers/densely-connected-convolution-network-connectionwise-zhang/0d1b9174659c5daca6271a7d6acddf7b/"
