(1) Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis using convolutional neural networks model,https://typeset.io/papers/alzheimers-disease-diagnosis-using-convolutional-neural-30db3j7flh,"Abstract: The global healthcare system and related fields are experiencing extensive transformations, taking inspiration from past trends to plan for a technologically advanced society. Neurodegenerative diseases are among the illnesses that are hardest to treat. Alzheimer’s disease is one of these conditions and is one of the leading causes of dementia. Due to the lack of permanent treatment and the complexity of managing symptoms as the severity grows, it is crucial to catch Alzheimer’s disease early. The objective of this study was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model to diagnose early-stage Alzheimer’s disease more accurately and with less data loss than methods previously discovered. CNN, is adept at processing and recognising images and has been employed in various diagnostic tools and research in the healthcare sector, showing limitless potential. Convolutional, pooling and fully linked layers are the common layers that make up a CNN. In this paper, five CNN modelswere randomly chosen (ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, Inception, and Xception) and were trained. ResNet performed the best and was chosen to undergo additional modifications to improve accuracy to 95.5%. This was a remarkable achievement that made us hopeful for the performance of this model in larger datasets as well as other disease detection."
(2) Improved neural network with multi-task learning for Alzheimer's disease classification,https://typeset.io/papers/improved-neural-network-with-multi-task-learning-for-e4cnqmlohu,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease(AD) poses a significant challenge due to its widespread prevalence and the lack of effective treatments, highlighting the urgent need for early detection. This research introduces an enhanced neural network, named ADnet, which is based on the VGG16 model, to detect Alzheimer's disease using two-dimensional MRI slices. ADNet incorporates several key improvements: it replaces traditional convolution with depthwise separable convolution to reduce model parameters, replaces the ReLU activation function with ELU to address potential issues with exploding gradients, and integrates the SE(Squeeze-and-Excitation) module to enhance feature extraction efficiency. In addition to the primary task of MRI feature extraction, ADnet is simultaneously trained on two auxiliary tasks: clinical dementia score regression and mental state score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the baseline VGG16, ADNet achieves a 4.18% accuracy improvement for AD vs. CN classification and a 6% improvement for MCI vs. CN classification. These findings highlight the effectiveness of ADnet in classifying Alzheimer's disease, providing crucial support for early diagnosis and intervention by medical professionals. The proposed enhancements represent advancements in neural network architecture and training strategies for improved AD classification."
(3) A novel CNN architecture for accurate early detection and classification of Alzheimer’s disease using MRI data,https://typeset.io/papers/a-novel-cnn-architecture-for-accurate-early-detection-and-2pudzc230k,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that requires accurate diagnosis for effective management and treatment. In this article, we propose an architecture for a convolutional neural network (CNN) that utilizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to categorize AD. The network employs two separate CNN models, each with distinct filter sizes and pooling layers, which are concatenated in a classification layer. The multi-class problem is addressed across three, four, and five categories. The proposed CNN architecture achieves exceptional accuracies of 99.43%, 99.57%, and 99.13%, respectively. These high accuracies demonstrate the efficacy of the network in capturing and discerning relevant features from MRI images, enabling precise classification of AD subtypes and stages. The network architecture leverages the hierarchical nature of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract both local and global patterns from the data, facilitating accurate discrimination between different AD categories. Accurate classification of AD carries significant clinical implications, including early detection, personalized treatment planning, disease monitoring, and prognostic assessment. The reported accuracy underscores the potential of the proposed CNN architecture to assist medical professionals and researchers in making precise and informed judgments regarding AD patients."
(4) Improving Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis on Brain MRI Scans with an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models,https://typeset.io/papers/improving-alzheimer-s-disease-diagnosis-on-brain-mri-scans-54ik4xfw5o,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurolog-ical condition affecting millions globally. It gradually advances, leading to memory loss, cognitive deterioration, and a substantial decline in overall quality of life for those affected. AD patients experience memory decline, eroding cherished memories and straining relationships, while daily tasks become challenging. Numerous investigations have been conducted in this field, as the timely identification of Alzheimer's disease at its initial stage is of the utmost importance. A major limitation in this field is the predominant emphasis on using single fine-tuned CNN architecture or comparing pre-trained and custom CNN models for Alzheimer's detection, often on small datasets, which neglects a more comprehensive approach. Using smaller datasets can negatively impact deep learning modeling accuracy due to overfitting, limited representation, and poor generalization. This study addresses the current research problems and proposes an ensemble approach that combines predictions from various pre-trained models, including DenseNet-121, EfficientNet B7, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and also from a Custom CNN. The model averaging ensemble method was applied, a subset of the Stacking Ensemble, to two ADNI datasets, with Dataset-I being the larger. The goal was to assess the efficacy of this ensemble approach for accurate multiclass classification on ADNI datasets, where it successfully identified all classes despite differing sample volumes. A vast experiment was conducted on two distinct and widely recognized real-world datasets, resulting in accuracies of 99.96% and 98.90% respectively. Finally, the outcome of the research compared with recent research findings demonstrates the potential of our approach in advancing Alzheimer's disease detection by outperforming other benchmark approaches by a significant margin."
(5) Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease using Random Oversampling and Albumentations on Convolutional Neural Network,https://typeset.io/papers/classification-of-alzheimers-disease-using-random-1bq5hdxgl4,"Abstract: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a brain disorder that causes dementia and affects the memory, cognitive, and behavioral function. Early detection for AD can help to reduce the symptoms and slow down AD progression. Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a component of artificial intelligence, has demonstrated efficacy in resolving image-related issues and has gained widespread use in the analysis of medical images. CNN works well on large datasets, however, in imbalanced datasets, it can perform poorly by misclassifying minority classes. In this study, the random over-sampling technique is used to address the imbalance in the dataset, while Albumentations is used for image augmentation to prevent overfitting. The results demonstrate that the combination of these techniques leads to improved classification performance compared to traditional approaches. The proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of AD diagnosis and contribute to the development of effective treatments for this debilitating condition."

By incorporating SMOTE, we aim to address challenges associated with data imbalance. The research also presents a comparison between this approach and traditional methods, offering insights into its relative performance."
(7) A Deep Learning Based Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using 3D CNN,https://typeset.io/papers/a-deep-learning-based-classification-of-alzheimer-s-disease-3650sjz8wr,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease(AD) is a critical neurological disorder frequently characterized by cognitive decline and physical deterioration. Currently, a combination of clinical evaluations and psychological testing is used to diagnose AD. Though these diagnoses aren't flawless, more sophisticated diagnostic equipment can help us learn more about AD and increase our capacity to identify the condition. Early and accurate diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention and personalized treatment strategies. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offers a window into the dynamic neural activity alterations associated with AD, presenting an opportunity for computational approaches to aid in disease classification. This study provides a deep learning-based approach that uses fMRI data to classify Alzheimer's disease cases. The proposed methodology leverages the power of deep neural networks to automatically extract intricate patterns and features from fMRI scans, capturing subtle functional alterations indicative of AD. This work employs a multi-layered 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to efficiently learn hierarchical representations from spatial and temporal characteristics of fMRI data. The model is trained on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) dataset, incorporating both healthy control subjects and individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The performance of the suggested deep learning-based method is thoroughly evaluated using a comprehensive set of metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Comparative analyses are conducted against traditional machine learning approaches and state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the superior classification performance and efficiency of the proposed model."
(8) Improved Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease With Convolutional Neural Networks,https://typeset.io/papers/improved-classification-of-alzheimers-disease-with-1a6tu16unx,"Abstract: This work focuses on classifying MRI images using machine learning models to identify Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, at an early stage [1]. It is now possible to identify and forecast the onset of AD by analyzing brain scans collected through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, classifying patients as either at risk or not. The main goal is to make precise predictions. Improved prediction and detection tools for radiologists, physicians, and caregivers will be made available as a result of the study’s determination of the likelihood that individuals would develop AD and proper categorization of them. Using machine learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and fastai—a user-friendly deep learning library and framework—we developed models using a dataset of 6400 MRI images from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 4 class for the early detection and classification of AD [2]. The models achieve an impressive accuracy rate of 84.4%, with the addition of a pre-trained Visual Geometry Group (VGG) layer to the sequential model, outperforming other algorithms. This study demonstrates a viable method for classifying and diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease early on, utilizing MRI images and machine learning models. The acquired accuracy rates show the models’ potential to assist doctors and other caregivers in AD diagnosis and management, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness."
(9) Convolutional Neural Network Deep Learning Approach for Alzheimer Disease Classification,https://typeset.io/papers/convolutional-neural-network-deep-learning-approach-for-8k73b26jb2,"Abstract: Numerous studies have explored the potential of deep learning (DL) in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). DL models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated their potential in accurately detecting and classifying AD based on various data sources, including brain imaging scans and clinical data. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a brain imaging tool that helps in AD detecting at an early stage and this can help to slow its progression. In this study, we developed and compared two CNN models from scratch for the classification of AD stages. The first model consisted of four convolutional layers, while the second model used five convolutional layers. By examining the results of both models, we aimed to identify the impact of the depth of the CNN architecture on the classification performance. To address the issue of imbalanced datasets, we employed data augmentation techniques. The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models with accuracies of the models of 94.79 and 98.30 respectively. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive comparison between our approaches and state-of-the-art models in the literature that have been used to classify the same dataset. We evaluated the models using various performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure."
(10) Performance Evaluation of CNN Models for Alzheimer’s Disease Detection with MRI Scans,https://typeset.io/papers/performance-evaluation-of-cnn-models-for-alzheimers-disease-2fwh7ga110,"Abstract: The primary symptom of Alzheimer's disease is memory impairment, which is a neurodegenerative condition. The manifestation of these symptoms can be attributed to the impairment of the cerebral nerve responsible for cognitive functions such as learning, thinking and memory. Alzheimer’s disease is a prominent cause of mortality and lacks a definitive curve. However, appropriate medicinal interventions have demonstrated the potential to mitigate the progression and severity of the condition. This study presents the comparison of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, namely ResNet50, VGG19 and VGG16 architectures, as an approach to construct an automated classification system for Alzheimer’s disease in future. The study utilises Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets to identify MRI datasets of individual with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), and late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI). In the conducted experiment, the study achieved accuracy rates of 91.18% and 94.56% while utilising an epoch size of 2. The accuracy results indicate that the VGG16 model outperforms the ResNet50 model. The utilisation of automated Alzheimer’s disease classification holds potential as an auxiliary tool for healthcare professionals in determining the stage of Alzheimer’s disease hence facilitating the administration of suitable medicinal interventions."
