(1) ScanQA: 3D Question Answering for Spatial Scene Understanding,https://typeset.io/papers/scanqa-3d-question-answering-for-spatial-scene-understanding-zp7mo391,"Abstract: We propose a new 3D spatial understanding task for 3D question answering (3D-QA). In the 3D-QA task, models receive visual information from the entire 3D scene of a rich RGB-D indoor scan and answer given textual questions about the 3D scene. Unlike the 2D-question answering of visual question answering, the conventional 2D-QA models suffer from problems with spatial understanding of object alignment and directions and fail in object localization from the textual questions in 3D-QA. We propose a baseline model for 3D-QA, called the ScanQA <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sup> <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sup> https://github.com/ATR-DBI/ScanQA, which learns a fused descriptor from 3D object proposals and encoded sentence embeddings. This learned descriptor correlates language expressions with the underlying geometric features of the 3D scan and facilitates the regression of 3D bounding boxes to determine the described objects in textual questions. We collected human-edited question-answer pairs with free-form answers grounded in 3D objects in each 3D scene. Our new ScanQA dataset contains over 41k question-answer pairs from 800 indoor scenes obtained from the ScanNet dataset. To the best of our knowledge, ScanQA is the first large-scale effort to perform object-grounded question answering in 3D environments."
(2) Learning a Task-Specific Descriptor for Robust Matching of 3D Point Clouds,https://typeset.io/papers/learning-a-task-specific-descriptor-for-robust-matching-of-3fbanf3g,"Abstract: Existing learning-based point feature descriptors are usually task-agnostic, which pursue describing the individual 3D point clouds as accurate as possible. However, the matching task aims at describing the corresponding points consistently across different 3D point clouds. Therefore these too accurate features may play a counterproductive role due to the inconsistent point feature representations of correspondences caused by the unpredictable noise, partiality, deformation, etc., in the local geometry. In this paper, we propose to learn a robust task-specific feature descriptor to consistently describe the correct point correspondence under interference. Born with an <underline xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">E</u> ncoder and a <underline xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">D</u> ynamic <underline xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">F</u> usion module, our method EDFNet develops from two aspects. First, we augment the matchability of correspondences by utilizing their repetitive local structure. To this end, a special encoder is designed to exploit two input point clouds jointly for each point descriptor. It not only captures the local geometry of each point in the current point cloud by convolution, but also exploits the repetitive structure from paired point cloud by Transformer. Second, we propose a dynamical fusion module to jointly use different scale features. There is an inevitable struggle between robustness and discriminativeness of the single scale feature. Specifically, the small scale feature is robust since little interference exists in this small receptive field. But it is not sufficiently discriminative as there are many repetitive local structures within a point cloud. Thus the resultant descriptors will lead to many incorrect matches. In contrast, the large scale feature is more discriminative by integrating more neighborhood information. But it is easier to be disturbed since there is much more interference in the large receptive field. Compared with the conventional fusion strategy that handles multiple scale features equally, we analyze the consistency of them to judge the clean ones and perform larger aggregation weights on them during fusion. Then, a robust and discriminative feature descriptor is achieved by focusing on multiple clean scale features. Extensive evaluations validate that EDFNet learns a task-specific descriptor, which achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance for robust matching of 3D point clouds."

(4) Learning to Fuse Local Geometric Features for 3D Rigid Data Matching,https://typeset.io/papers/learning-to-fuse-local-geometric-features-for-3d-rigid-data-2uaf4mwtcc,"Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet very effective data-driven approach to fuse both low-level and high-level local geometric features for 3D rigid data matching. It is a common practice to generate distinctive geometric descriptors by fusing low-level features from various viewpoints or subspaces, or enhance geometric feature matching by leveraging multiple high-level features. In prior works, they are typically performed via linear operations such as concatenation and min pooling. We show that more compact and distinctive representations can be achieved by optimizing a neural network (NN) model under the triplet framework that non-linearly fuses local geometric features in Euclidean spaces. The NN model is trained by an improved triplet loss function that fully leverages all pairwise relationships within the triplet. Moreover, the fused descriptor by our approach is also competitive to deep learned descriptors from raw data while being more lightweight and rotational invariant. Experimental results on four standard datasets with various data modalities and application contexts confirm the advantages of our approach in terms of both feature matching and geometric registration."
(5) ScanRefer: 3D Object Localization in RGB-D Scans using Natural Language,https://typeset.io/papers/scanrefer-3d-object-localization-in-rgb-d-scans-using-4gxyhn7rll,"Abstract: We introduce the task of 3D object localization in RGB-D scans using natural language descriptions. As input, we assume a point cloud of a scanned 3D scene along with a free-form description of a specified target object. To address this task, we propose ScanRefer, learning a fused descriptor from 3D object proposals and encoded sentence embeddings. This fused descriptor correlates language expressions with geometric features, enabling regression of the 3D bounding box of a target object. We also introduce the ScanRefer dataset, containing

(6) A Robust Fused Descriptor Under Unconstrained Conditions,https://typeset.io/papers/a-robust-fused-descriptor-under-unconstrained-conditions-3mxlnr5x,"Abstract: This work presents local difference binary pattern (LDBP) and local neighborhood difference binary pattern (LNDBP) descriptors for face analysis. In LDBP, the difference is computed between A and B. A computes the difference between current neighbor pixel and adjacent neighbor pixel in clockwise direction, and B computes the difference between current neighbor pixel and center pixel. Same concept is performed for all the neighborhood positions. In LNDBP, the difference is determined between neighbor pixels at a distance of +2 in clockwise direction. Those possesses (differences) the value > or = to 0 are allocated a label 1 else 0. All patterns encoding gives the emergence of respective transformed image. From respective image, the subregional (3 Ã— 3) information is extracted. The fused features from the corresponding subregions are the feature dimension of the respective descriptor. Further the LDBP and LNDBP dimensions are integrated to make the discriminative feature LDBP + LNDBP. PCA is applied next for compaction, and classification matching is done by SVMs and NN."
(7) Fusion Models for Improved Image Captioning.,https://typeset.io/papers/fusion-models-for-improved-image-captioning-4t9slpjrhy,"Abstract: Visual captioning aims to generate textual descriptions given images or videos. Traditionally, image captioning models are trained on human annotated datasets such as Flickr30k and MS-COCO, which are limited in size and diversity. This limitation hinders the generalization capabilities of these models while also rendering them liable to making mistakes. Language models can, however, be trained on vast amounts of freely available unlabelled data and have recently emerged as successful language encoders [10] and coherent text generators [4]. Meanwhile, several unimodal and multimodal fusion techniques have been proven to work well for natural language generation [11] and automatic speech recognition [30]. Building on these recent developments, and with the aim of improving the quality of generated captions, the contribution of our work in this paper is two-fold: First, we propose a generic multimodal model fusion framework for caption generation as well as emendation where we utilize different fusion strategies to integrate a pretrained Auxiliary Language Model (AuxLM) within the traditional encoder-decoder visual captioning frameworks. Next, we employ the same fusion strategies to integrate a pretrained Masked Language Model (MLM), namely BERT, with a visual captioning model, viz. Show, Attend, and Tell, for emending both syntactic and semantic errors in captions. Our caption emendation experiments on three benchmark image captioning datasets, viz. Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO, show improvements over the baseline, indicating the usefulness of our proposed multimodal fusion strategies. Further, we perform a preliminary qualitative analysis on the emended captions and identify error categories based on the type of corrections."
(8) A Hierarchical Attention Fused Descriptor for 3D Point Matching,https://typeset.io/papers/a-hierarchical-attention-fused-descriptor-for-3d-point-18r8cducls,"Abstract: Motivated by recent successes on learning 3D feature representations, we present a Siamese network to generate representative 3D descriptors for 3D point matching in point cloud registration. Our system, dubbed HAF-Net, consists of feature extraction module, hierarchical feature reweighting and recalibration module (HRR), as well as feature aggregation and compression module. The HRR module is proposed to adaptively integrate multi-level features through learning, acting as a hierarchical attention fusion mechanism. The learnable feature pooling technique VLAD is extended into our aggregation module, which is further utilized to extract principal components of features and compress them into a low dimensional feature vector. To train our model, we amass a large dataset for 3D point matching. The dataset is composed of matched and unmatched point block pairs, which are automatically searched from existing reconstruction datasets with known poses. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed HAF-Net not only outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in 3D feature representation but also has a good generalization ability in various tasks and datasets."
(9) Multi-scale and multi-level shape descriptor learning via a hybrid fusion network,https://typeset.io/papers/multi-scale-and-multi-level-shape-descriptor-learning-via-a-25wq9y59,"Abstract: Discriminative and informative 3D shape descriptors are of fundamental significance to computer graphics applications, especially in the fields of geometry modeling and shape analysis. 3D shape descriptors, which reveal extrinsic/intrinsic properties of 3D shapes, have been well studied for decades and proved to be useful and effective in various analysis and synthesis tasks. Nonetheless, existing descriptors are mainly founded upon certain local differential attributes or global shape spectra, and certain combinations of both types. Conventional descriptors are typically customized for specific tasks with priori domain knowledge, which severely prevents their applications from widespread use. Recently, neural networks, benefiting from their powerful data-driven capability for general feature extraction from raw data without any domain knowledge, have achieved great success in many areas including shape analysis. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid fusion network (HFN) that learns multi-scale and multi-level shape representations via uniformly integrating a traditional region-based descriptor with modern neural networks. On one hand, we exploit the spectral graph wavelets (SGWs) to extract the shapesâ€™ local-to-global features. On the other hand, the shapes are fed into a convolutional neural network to generate multi-level features simultaneously. Then a hierarchical fusion network learns a general and unified representation from these two different types of features which capture multi-scale and multi-level properties of the underlying shapes. Extensive experiments and comprehensive comparisons demonstrate our HFN can achieve better performance in common shape analysis tasks, such as shape retrieval and recognition, and the learned hybrid descriptor is robust, informative, and discriminative with more potential for widespread applications."
