(1) Rapid Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using Advanced Artificial Intelligence Algorithms,https://typeset.io/papers/rapid-alzheimer-s-disease-diagnosis-using-advanced-3cjux9yo4m,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, predominantly impacting the elderly and characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Early and precise detection is critical for effective management and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods such as neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are often invasive, expensive, and time- consuming. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) provide promising alternatives that are non-invasive, efficient, and cost-effective. This study explores the application of various ML algorithms to predict Alzheimer's disease. The methodology involved data preprocessing and feature selection using the Spearman algorithm to enhance computational efficiency and model performance. We evaluated k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Trees (DT), and Ensemble methods. Results indicate that the Ensemble method achieved a predictive accuracy of 94.07% using only 13 features. These results demonstrate the potential of ML algorithms in revolutionizing AD diagnostics, offering scalable and accurate solutions for early detection."
(2) Innovative Deep-Learning Method for MRI-Based Autonomous Alzheimer’s Disorder Identification,https://typeset.io/papers/innovative-deep-learning-method-for-mri-based-autonomous-4rboc5wa6a,"Abstract: Using the examination of Imaging information sets, this paper presents an innovative neural network approach tailored for detecting Alzheimer’s Illness (AI). There are several difficulties in using neuroimaging images examinations to diagnose AI. Because the scans of an AI patient with a normalizing brain show resemblance it can be difficult to diagnose AI in minor to extremely mild stages visually. Prevention for AI is vital. Exact identification of AI is necessary. Recent investigation has demonstrated that machine learning methods are extremely successful than individuals at differentiating between different phases of AI, allowing for timely identification and treatment. The objective of this investigation is to create a novel method that makes use of previously trained deep neural networks in order to reliably identify the various degrees of AI extent, especially when the number as well as calibre of readily accessible information are constrained. This method processes the AI information using an advanced image analysis component before the modelling stage. Applying 4 AI datasets three for the minor, extremely mild, and moderate phases of the illness, in addition to one for the usual stage the suggested approach was contrasted against two popular neural network Visual Geometry Group 16 along with Residual Network 50. This made it possible for us to assess how well the categorization findings worked. Six evaluation standards were employed for evaluating the various approaches. Our technique outperforms any other algorithms currently in use, including a general identification precision of 98.34%, according to the findings."
(3) An Explainable AI Paradigm for Alzheimer’s Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning,https://typeset.io/papers/an-explainable-ai-paradigm-for-alzheimers-diagnosis-using-4gp0ub5irt,"Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide, causing severe cognitive decline and memory impairment. The early and accurate diagnosis of AD is crucial for effective intervention and disease management. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promising results in medical image analysis, including AD diagnosis from neuroimaging data. However, the lack of interpretability in deep learning models hinders their adoption in clinical settings, where explainability is essential for gaining trust and acceptance from healthcare professionals. In this study, we propose an explainable AI (XAI)-based approach for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, leveraging the power of deep transfer learning and ensemble modeling. The proposed framework aims to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models by incorporating XAI techniques, allowing clinicians to understand the decision-making process and providing valuable insights into disease diagnosis. By leveraging popular pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate their individual performances on a comprehensive dataset. The proposed ensembles, Ensemble-1 (VGG16 and VGG19) and Ensemble-2 (DenseNet169 and DenseNet201), demonstrated superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores compared to individual models, reaching up to 95%. In order to enhance interpretability and transparency in Alzheimer’s diagnosis, we introduced a novel model achieving an impressive accuracy of 96%. This model incorporates explainable AI techniques, including saliency maps and grad-CAM (gradient-weighted class activation mapping). The integration of these techniques not only contributes to the model’s exceptional accuracy but also provides clinicians and researchers with visual insights into the neural regions influencing the diagnosis. Our findings showcase the potential of combining deep transfer learning with explainable AI in the realm of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, paving the way for more interpretable and clinically relevant AI models in healthcare."
(4) Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease using dual GAN model with pyramid attention networks,https://typeset.io/papers/early-diagnosis-of-alzheimers-disease-using-dual-gan-model-1yctn4g95u,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that impairs the patient's cognitive function. The article presents a deep learning architecture using the implicit image from MRI to categories MRI scans and detect AD on time. The annotated data is divided into patients with AD and control groups. After GAN creates the synthetic and real images, the dataset is passed through CNN to detect spatial features from the scans. We used 30 slices from the region of the top brain above the eyes for learning. In order to train the CNNs and evaluate the results, the data is divided using the 10-fold cross-validation evaluating technique to validate the model, the accuracy estimates are 99.67%, 98.76%, respectively."
(5) Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease via optimized lightweight convolution-attention and structural MRI.,https://typeset.io/papers/diagnosis-of-alzheimer-s-disease-via-optimized-lightweight-41fau6opgf,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a substantial public health challenge, demanding accurate screening and diagnosis. Identifying AD in its early stages, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy control (HC), is crucial given the global aging population. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is essential for understanding the brain's structural changes due to atrophy. While current deep learning networks overlook voxel long-term dependencies, vision transformers (ViT) excel at recognizing such dependencies in images, making them valuable in AD diagnosis. Our proposed method integrates convolution-attention mechanisms in transformer-based classifiers for AD brain datasets, enhancing performance without excessive computing resources. Replacing multi-head attention with lightweight multi-head self-attention (LMHSA), employing inverted residual (IRU) blocks, and introducing local feed-forward networks (LFFN) yields exceptional results. Training on AD datasets with a gradient-centralized optimizer and Adam achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 94.31% for multi-class classification, rising to 95.37% for binary classification (AD vs. HC) and 92.15% for HC vs. MCI. These outcomes surpass existing AD diagnosis approaches, showcasing the model's efficacy. Identifying key brain regions aids future clinical solutions for AD and neurodegenerative diseases. However, this study focused exclusively on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, emphasizing the need for a more robust, generalizable approach incorporating diverse databases beyond ADNI in future research."
(6) AI-based tool for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease,https://typeset.io/papers/ai-based-tool-for-early-detection-of-alzheimers-disease-1it3l0jykd,"Abstract: <h2>Abstract</h2> In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), timely identification is paramount for effective management, acknowledging its chronic and irreversible nature, where medications can only impede its progression. Our study introduces a holistic solution, leveraging the hippocampus and the VGG16 model with transfer learning for early AD detection. The hippocampus, a pivotal early affected region linked to memory, plays a central role in classifying patients into three categories: cognitively normal (CN), representing individuals without cognitive impairment; mild cognitive impairment (MCI), indicative of a subtle decline in cognitive abilities; and AD, denoting Alzheimer's disease. Employing the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, our model undergoes training enriched by advanced image preprocessing techniques, achieving outstanding accuracy (testing 98.17%, validation 97.52%, training 99.62%). The strategic use of transfer learning fortifies our competitive edge, incorporating the hippocampus approach and, notably, a progressive data augmentation technique. This innovative augmentation strategy gradually introduces augmentation factors during training, significantly elevating accuracy and enhancing the model's generalization ability. The study emphasizes practical application with a user-friendly website, empowering radiologists to predict class probabilities, track disease progression, and visualize patient images in both 2D and 3D formats, contributing significantly to the advancement of early AD detection."
(7) The Application of Artificial Intelligence in Alzheimer's Research,https://typeset.io/papers/the-application-of-artificial-intelligence-in-alzheimer-s-3b45ory87m,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible and neurodegenerative disease that slowly impairs memory and neurocognitive function, but the etiology of AD is still unclear. With the explosive growth of electronic health data, the application of artificial intelligence (Al) in the healthcare setting provides excellent potential for exploring etiology and personalized treatment approaches, and improving the disease's diagnostic and prognostic outcome. This paper first briefly introduces Al technologies and applications in medicine, and then presents a comprehensive review of Al in AD. In simple, it includes etiology discovery based on genetic data, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), computer-aided prognosis (CAP) of AD using multi-modality data (genetic, neuroimaging and linguistic data), and pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches for treating AD. Later, some popular publicly available AD datasets are introduced, which are important for advancing Al technologies in AD analysis. Finally, core research challenges and future research directions are discussed."
(8) Bayesian Network Modelling for the Clinical Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,https://typeset.io/papers/bayesian-network-modelling-for-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-3tdqyee9zo,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressively debilitating disease commonly affecting the elderly. Correct diagnosis is important for patients to access suitable therapies and support that can help improve or manage symptoms of the condition. Reports of misdiagnosis and difficulty diagnosing AD highlight existing clinical challenges. Here we propose a Bayesian network as a preliminary model for a complementary clinical diagnostic tool for dementia due to AD and mild cognitive impairment due to AD. The model structure was built based on medical reasoning patterns which help bridge the gap between clinical professionals and algorithmic decision making. The parameters of the model were specified from a combination of learning from data (using the NACC Uniform Data Set), extracting data from literature, and knowledge-based judgment. The resulting model includes variables laid out in NIA-AA diagnostic criteria and differentiates actual AD cases from formal AD diagnoses. The model is validated against a range of real-world data. Unlike machine-learnt (black box) AI models, this model provides a visible and auditable justification for its predictions and can be used for multiple types of 'what if analysis'. An easy-to-use web accessible version of the model has been made available."
(9) Improving Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis on Brain MRI Scans with an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models,https://typeset.io/papers/improving-alzheimer-s-disease-diagnosis-on-brain-mri-scans-54ik4xfw5o,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurolog-ical condition affecting millions globally. It gradually advances, leading to memory loss, cognitive deterioration, and a substantial decline in overall quality of life for those affected. AD patients experience memory decline, eroding cherished memories and straining relationships, while daily tasks become challenging. Numerous investigations have been conducted in this field, as the timely identification of Alzheimer's disease at its initial stage is of the utmost importance. A major limitation in this field is the predominant emphasis on using single fine-tuned CNN architecture or comparing pre-trained and custom CNN models for Alzheimer's detection, often on small datasets, which neglects a more comprehensive approach. Using smaller datasets can negatively impact deep learning modeling accuracy due to overfitting, limited representation, and poor generalization. This study addresses the current research problems and proposes an ensemble approach that combines predictions from various pre-trained models, including DenseNet-121, EfficientNet B7, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and also from a Custom CNN. The model averaging ensemble method was applied, a subset of the Stacking Ensemble, to two ADNI datasets, with Dataset-I being the larger. The goal was to assess the efficacy of this ensemble approach for accurate multiclass classification on ADNI datasets, where it successfully identified all classes despite differing sample volumes. A vast experiment was conducted on two distinct and widely recognized real-world datasets, resulting in accuracies of 99.96% and 98.90% respectively. Finally, the outcome of the research compared with recent research findings demonstrates the potential of our approach in advancing Alzheimer's disease detection by outperforming other benchmark approaches by a significant margin."
(10) AI-Aided Diagnosis For Neurodegenerative Diseases: Prospects And Challenges,https://typeset.io/papers/ai-aided-diagnosis-for-neurodegenerative-diseases-prospects-50v799w04r,"Abstract: Neurodegenerative disease (ND) represents a chronic disease characterized by loss of neuron function and death, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. It’s difficult and complex to diagnose ND, due to the requirement for the synthesis of multiple biomarker data, such as genes, proteins, images, etc. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, particularly through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, introduces novel methodologies and tools for ND diagnosis. These methodologies extract pertinent information and patterns from massive, multidimensional, and non-linear data, assisting doctors to render more precise, prompt, and objective assessments. This article provides an overview of the updated implementation status of AI in ND diagnosis, assesses the advantages and contributions of AI to ND diagnosis, as well as the existing limitations and challenges, and offers insights to the future development direction of AI in ND diagnosis."
