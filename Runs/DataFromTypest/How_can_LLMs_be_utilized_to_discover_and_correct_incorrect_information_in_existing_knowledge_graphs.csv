(1) Assessing LLMs Suitability for Knowledge Graph Completion,https://typeset.io/papers/assessing-llms-suitability-for-knowledge-graph-completion-4mfxp8v01t,"Abstract: Recent work shown the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve tasks related to Knowledge Graphs, such as Knowledge Graph Completion, even in Zero- or Few-Shot paradigms. However, they are known to hallucinate answers, or output results in a non-deterministic manner, thus leading to wrongly reasoned responses, even if they satisfy the user's demands. To highlight opportunities and challenges in knowledge graphs-related tasks, we experiment with two distinguished LLMs, namely Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, on Knowledge Graph Completion for static knowledge graphs, using prompts constructed following the TELeR taxonomy, in Zero- and One-Shot contexts, on a Task-Oriented Dialogue system use case. When evaluated using both strict and flexible metrics measurement manners, our results show that LLMs could be fit for such a task if prompts encapsulate sufficient information and relevant examples."
(2) Knowledge Graph-based Thought: a knowledge graph enhanced LLMs framework for pan-cancer question answering,https://typeset.io/papers/knowledge-graph-based-thought-a-knowledge-graph-enhanced-4kc03k1rdy,"Abstract: Background In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, notably in biomedical sciences. However, their real-world application is often limited by issues like erroneous outputs and hallucinatory responses. Results We developed the Knowledge Graph-based Thought (KGT) framework, an innovative solution that integrates LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve their initial responses by utilizing verifiable information from KGs, thus significantly reducing factual errors in reasoning. The KGT framework demonstrates strong adaptability and performs well across various open-source LLMs. Notably, KGT can facilitate the discovery of new uses for existing drugs through potential drug-cancer associations, and can assist in predicting resistance by analyzing relevant biomarkers and genetic mechanisms. To evaluate the Knowledge Graph Question Answering task within biomedicine, we utilize a pan-cancer knowledge graph to develop a pan-cancer question answering benchmark, named the Pan-cancer Question Answering (PcQA). Conclusions The KGT framework substantially improves the accuracy and utility of LLMs in the biomedical field, demonstrating its exceptional performance in biomedical question answering. Key Points We introduce a framework combining LLMs with KGs to improve factual accuracy in LLM reasoning. Our system is a flexible architecture that seamlessly integrates various LLMs. Utilizing a pan-cancer knowledge graph, we have proposed the first KGQA benchmark in the field of biomedicine. Case studies reveal our method enhanced LLMs in addressing biomedical challenges such as drug repositioning, resistance research, individualized treatment, and biomarker analysis. The method performs favorably in comparison to existing methods."
(3) Explore then Determine: A GNN-LLM Synergy Framework for Reasoning over Knowledge Graph,https://typeset.io/papers/explore-then-determine-a-gnn-llm-synergy-framework-for-27m6dkvvok,"Abstract: The task of reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to the complex structure and large amounts of irrelevant information. Existing LLM reasoning methods overlook the importance of compositional learning on KG to supply with precise knowledge. Besides, the fine-tuning and frequent interaction with LLMs incur substantial time and resource costs. This paper focuses on the Question Answering over Knowledge Graph (KGQA) task and proposes an Explore-then-Determine (EtD) framework that synergizes LLMs with graph neural networks (GNNs) for reasoning over KGs. The Explore stage employs a lightweight GNN to explore promising candidates and relevant fine-grained knowledge to the questions, while the Determine stage utilizes the explored information to construct a knowledge-enhanced multiple-choice prompt, guiding a frozen LLM to determine the final answer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that EtD achieves state-of-the-art performance and generates faithful reasoning results."
(4) Knowledge Graph Enhanced Large Language Model Editing,https://typeset.io/papers/knowledge-graph-enhanced-large-language-model-editing-3rjsknqxqe,"Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are pivotal in advancing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their efficacy is hampered by inaccuracies and outdated knowledge. Model editing emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges. However, existing editing methods struggle to track and incorporate changes in knowledge associated with edits, which limits the generalization ability of postedit LLMs in processing edited knowledge. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel model editing method that leverages knowledge graphs for enhancing LLM editing, namely GLAME. Specifically, we first utilize a knowledge graph augmentation module to uncover associated knowledge that has changed due to editing, obtaining its internal representations within LLMs. This approach allows knowledge alterations within LLMs to be reflected through an external graph structure. Subsequently, we design a graph-based knowledge edit module to integrate structured knowledge into the model editing. This ensures that the updated parameters reflect not only the modifications of the edited knowledge but also the changes in other associated knowledge resulting from the editing process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on GPT-J and GPT-2 XL demonstrate that GLAME significantly improves the generalization capabilities of post-edit LLMs in employing edited knowledge."
(5) Knowledge Graphs as Context Sources for LLM-Based Explanations of Learning Recommendations,https://typeset.io/papers/knowledge-graphs-as-context-sources-for-llm-based-1mzezu3na4,"Abstract: In the era of personalized education, the provision of comprehensible explanations for learning recommendations is of a great value to enhance the learner's understanding and engagement with the recommended learning content. Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI in general have recently opened new doors for generating human-like explanations, for and along learning recommendations. However, their precision is still far away from acceptable in a sensitive field like education. To harness the abilities of LLMs, while still ensuring a high level of precision towards the intent of the learners, this paper proposes an approach to utilize knowledge graphs (KG) as a source of factual context, for LLM prompts, reducing the risk of model hallucinations, and safeguarding against wrong or imprecise information, while maintaining an application-intended learning context. We utilize the semantic relations in the knowledge graph to offer curated knowledge about learning recommendations. With domain-experts in the loop, we design the explanation as a textual template, which is filled and completed by the LLM. Domain experts were integrated in the prompt engineering phase as part of a study, to ensure that explanations include information that is relevant to the learner. We evaluate our approach quantitatively using Rouge-N and Rouge-L measures, as well as qualitatively with experts and learners. Our results show an enhanced recall and precision of the generated explanations compared to those generated solely by the GPT model, with a greatly reduced risk of generating imprecise information in the final learning explanation."
(6) Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models (LLMs)in Learning on Graphs,https://typeset.io/papers/exploring-the-potential-of-large-language-models-llms-in-15p8xwpozx,"Abstract: Learning on Graphs has attracted immense attention due to its wide real-world applications. The most popular pipeline for learning on graphs with textual node attributes primarily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and utilizes shallow text embedding as initial node representations, which has limitations in general knowledge and profound semantic understanding. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to possess extensive common knowledge and powerful semantic comprehension abilities that have revolutionized existing workflows to handle text data. In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of LLMs in graph machine learning, especially the node classification task, and investigate two possible pipelines: LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors. The former leverages LLMs to enhance nodes' text attributes with their massive knowledge and then generate predictions through GNNs. The latter attempts to directly employ LLMs as standalone predictors. We conduct comprehensive and systematical studies on these two pipelines under various settings. From comprehensive empirical results, we make original observations and find new insights that open new possibilities and suggest promising directions to leverage LLMs for learning on graphs.

(7) On Exploring the Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs,https://typeset.io/papers/on-exploring-the-reasoning-capability-of-large-language-o6p14jekd5,"Abstract: This paper examines the capacity of LLMs to reason with knowledge graphs using their internal knowledge graph, i.e., the knowledge graph they learned during pre-training. Two research questions are formulated to investigate the accuracy of LLMs in recalling information from pre-training knowledge graphs and their ability to infer knowledge graph relations from context. To address these questions, we employ LLMs to perform four distinct knowledge graph reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we identify two types of hallucinations that may occur during knowledge reasoning with LLMs: content and ontology hallucination. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can successfully tackle both simple and complex knowledge graph reasoning tasks from their own memory, as well as infer from input context."
(8) CriticBench: Benchmarking LLMs for Critique-Correct Reasoning,https://typeset.io/papers/criticbench-benchmarking-llms-for-critique-correct-reasoning-5bb2rd9i6r,"Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to critique and refine their reasoning is crucial for their application in evaluation, feedback provision, and self-improvement. This paper introduces CriticBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess LLMs' abilities to critique and rectify their reasoning across a variety of tasks. CriticBench encompasses five reasoning domains: mathematical, commonsense, symbolic, coding, and algorithmic. It compiles 15 datasets and incorporates responses from three LLM families. Utilizing CriticBench, we evaluate and dissect the performance of 17 LLMs in generation, critique, and correction reasoning, i.e., GQC reasoning. Our findings reveal: (1) a linear relationship in GQC capabilities, with critique-focused training markedly enhancing performance; (2) a task-dependent variation in correction effectiveness, with logic-oriented tasks being more amenable to correction; (3) GQC knowledge inconsistencies that decrease as model size increases; and (4) an intriguing inter-model critiquing dynamic, where stronger models are better at critiquing weaker ones, while weaker models can surprisingly surpass stronger ones in their self-critique. We hope these insights into the nuanced critique-correct reasoning of LLMs will foster further research in LLM critique and self-improvement."
(9) Unveiling LLMs: The Evolution of Latent Representations in a Temporal Knowledge Graph,https://typeset.io/papers/unveiling-llms-the-evolution-of-latent-representations-in-a-5eamd78nmr,"Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive capacity to recall a vast range of common factual knowledge information. However, unravelling the underlying reasoning of LLMs and explaining their internal mechanisms of exploiting this factual knowledge remain active areas of investigation. Our work analyzes the factual knowledge encoded in the latent representation of LLMs when prompted to assess the truthfulness of factual claims. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly decodes the factual knowledge embedded in the latent space of LLMs from a vector space to a set of ground predicates and represents its evolution across the layers using a temporal knowledge graph. Our framework relies on the technique of activation patching which intervenes in the inference computation of a model by dynamically altering its latent representations. Consequently, we neither rely on external models nor training processes. We showcase our framework with local and global interpretability analyses using two claim verification datasets: FEVER and CLIMATE-FEVER. The local interpretability analysis exposes different latent errors from representation to multi-hop reasoning errors. On the other hand, the global analysis uncovered patterns in the underlying evolution of the model's factual knowledge (e.g., store-and-seek factual information). By enabling graph-based analyses of the latent representations, this work represents a step towards the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs."
