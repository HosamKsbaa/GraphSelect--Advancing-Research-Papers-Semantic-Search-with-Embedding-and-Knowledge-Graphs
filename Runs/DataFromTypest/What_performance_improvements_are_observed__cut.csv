(1) An optimised deep learning approach for alzheimer’s disease classification,https://typeset.io/papers/an-optimised-deep-learning-approach-for-alzheimers-disease-3qm91htvnl,"Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and incurable brain disorder. It starts out subtly and gets worse with time. 60 to 70 percent of dementia cases are brought on by this illness. An Alzheimer’s patient is diagnosed every two seconds, according to research. The complexity of the brain makes it often very challenging to identify in elderly people. In the area of medical imaging, deep learning is growing. Several deep learning techniques that attempted to identify and categorise the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images into four stages of AD will be compared in this work. 6400 MRI brain images were extracted from a dataset and divided into training, validation, and testing datasets. In our research on twelve deep learning architectures, inceptionV3 has given the best results with 99.56% and 97.75% accuracy on train and validation, respectively, and on test data, the model has achieved an accuracy of 95.81%. We trained the models using optimised ImageNet weights, which resulted in higher accuracy across all twelve models."

Early detection is paramount to impede its progression. This study aims to construct an optimized deep learning (DL) framework for early AD detection and classification using magnetic resonance images (MRI) scans.

A systematic evaluation is conducted to optimize hyper-parameters, with extensive experimentation. The results demonstrate superior classification performance of the customized DL models compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, visual geometry group 16 (VGG16) achieves the highest accuracy of 95.85%, followed by ResNet50 with 89.38%, while InceptionV3 yields the lowest accuracy of 87.23%.

This study presents a novel approach aimed at enhancing AD diagnosis through the integration of transfer learning, deep learning techniques, and meticulous data preprocessing methodologies. Leveraging a rich dataset from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), comprising MRI scans from both healthy individuals and those with AD, the proposed method seeks to identify subtle abnormalities indicative of the disease.

The dataset contains 6400 magnetic resonance images in .jpg format, with standardized dimensions of 176 × 208 pixels. To demonstrate the advantages of data augmentation and transformation techniques, four scenarios were created: two without these techniques, utilizing the Adam and SGD optimizers, and two with these techniques, also employing the Adam and SGD optimizers, respectively. The main results revealed that scenarios utilizing these techniques exhibited more stable performance when validated with a new dataset. Scenario 3, using the Adam optimizer, achieved a weighted average accuracy of 91.83%, whereas scenario 4, employing the SGD optimizer, reached 87.58% accuracy. In contrast, scenarios 1 and 2, which omitted these techniques, obtained low accuracies below 55%. It is concluded that classifying AD with a DL model exceeding 90% accuracy is feasible.
