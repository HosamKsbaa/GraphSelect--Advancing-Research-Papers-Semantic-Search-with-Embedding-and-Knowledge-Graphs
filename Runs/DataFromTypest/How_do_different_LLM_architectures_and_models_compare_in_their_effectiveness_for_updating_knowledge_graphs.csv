(1) AriGraph: Learning Knowledge Graph World Models with Episodic Memory for LLM Agents,https://typeset.io/papers/arigraph-learning-knowledge-graph-world-models-with-episodic-xvgwvwiylh,"Abstract: Advancements in generative AI have broadened the potential applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the development of autonomous agents. Achieving true autonomy requires accumulating and updating knowledge gained from interactions with the environment and effectively utilizing it. Current LLM-based approaches leverage past experiences using a full history of observations, summarization or retrieval augmentation. However, these unstructured memory representations do not facilitate the reasoning and planning essential for complex decision-making. In our study, we introduce AriGraph, a novel method wherein the agent constructs a memory graph that integrates semantic and episodic memories while exploring the environment. This graph structure facilitates efficient associative retrieval of interconnected concepts, relevant to the agent's current state and goals, thus serving as an effective environmental model that enhances the agent's exploratory and planning capabilities. We demonstrate that our Ariadne LLM agent, equipped with this proposed memory architecture augmented with planning and decision-making, effectively handles complex tasks on a zero-shot basis in the TextWorld environment. Our approach markedly outperforms established methods such as full-history, summarization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation in various tasks, including the cooking challenge from the First TextWorld Problems competition and novel tasks like house cleaning and puzzle Treasure Hunting."
(2) Enhancing Knowledge Graph Consistency through Open Large Language Models: A Case Study,https://typeset.io/papers/enhancing-knowledge-graph-consistency-through-open-large-2q9mqqdtvy,"Abstract: High-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) play a crucial role in many applications. However, KGs created by automated information extraction systems can suffer from erroneous extractions or be inconsistent with provenance/source text. It is important to identify and correct such problems. In this paper, we study leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to detect inconsistencies between extracted facts and their provenance. With a focus on “open” LLMs that can be run and trained locally, we find that few-shot approaches can yield an absolute performance gain of 2.5-3.4% over the state-of-the-art method with only 9% of training data. We examine the LLM archi-tectures’ effect and show that Decoder-Only models under-perform Encoder-Decoder approaches. We also explore how model size impacts performance and counterintuitively find that larger models do not result in consistent performance gains. Our detailed analyses suggest that while LLMs can improve KG consistency, the different LLM models learn different aspects of KG consistency and are sensitive to the number of entities involved."
(3) Benchmarking the Abilities of Large Language Models for RDF Knowledge Graph Creation and Comprehension: How Well Do LLMs Speak Turtle?,https://typeset.io/papers/benchmarking-the-abilities-of-large-language-models-for-rdf-1nr0vkx0ht,"Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing at a rapid pace, with significant improvements at natural language processing and coding tasks. Yet, their ability to work with formal languages representing data, specifically within the realm of knowledge graph engineering, remains under-investigated. To evaluate the proficiency of various LLMs, we created a set of five tasks that probe their ability to parse, understand, analyze, and create knowledge graphs serialized in Turtle syntax. These tasks, each embodying distinct degrees of complexity and being able to scale with the size of the problem, have been integrated into our automated evaluation system, the LLM-KG-Bench. The evaluation encompassed four commercially available LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 1.3, and Claude 2.0, as well as two freely accessible offline models, GPT4All Vicuna and GPT4All Falcon 13B. This analysis offers an in-depth understanding of the strengths and shortcomings of LLMs in relation to their application within RDF knowledge graph engineering workflows utilizing Turtle representation. While our findings show that the latest commercial models outperform their forerunners in terms of proficiency with the Turtle language, they also reveal an apparent weakness. These models fall short when it comes to adhering strictly to the output formatting constraints, a crucial requirement in this context."
(4) Adapting Multilingual LLMs to Low-Resource Languages with Knowledge Graphs via Adapters,https://typeset.io/papers/adapting-multilingual-llms-to-low-resource-languages-with-333oibunhe,"Abstract: This paper explores the integration of graph knowledge from linguistic ontologies into multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) using adapters to improve performance for low-resource languages (LRLs) in sentiment analysis (SA) and named entity recognition (NER). Building upon successful parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as K-ADAPTER and MAD-X, we propose a similar approach for incorporating knowledge from multilingual graphs, connecting concepts in various languages with each other through linguistic relationships, into multilingual LLMs for LRLs. Specifically, we focus on eight LRLs -- Maltese, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Nepali, Javanese, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Sinhala -- and employ language-specific adapters fine-tuned on data extracted from the language-specific section of ConceptNet, aiming to enable knowledge transfer across the languages covered by the knowledge graph. We compare various fine-tuning objectives, including standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with targeted masking, to analyse their effectiveness in learning and integrating the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific tasks, we assess how structured graph knowledge affects the performance of multilingual LLMs for LRLs in SA and NER, providing insights into the potential benefits of adapting language models for low-resource scenarios."
(5) Efficient Knowledge Infusion via KG-LLM Alignment,https://typeset.io/papers/efficient-knowledge-infusion-via-kg-llm-alignment-4zzibivr6a,"Abstract: To tackle the problem of domain-specific knowledge scarcity within large language models (LLMs), knowledge graph-retrievalaugmented method has been proven to be an effective and efficient technique for knowledge infusion. However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: knowledge mismatch between public available knowledge graphs and the specific domain of the task at hand, and poor information compliance of LLMs with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we leverage a small set of labeled samples and a large-scale corpus to efficiently construct domain-specific knowledge graphs by an LLM, addressing the issue of knowledge mismatch. Additionally, we propose a three-stage KG-LLM alignment strategyto enhance the LLM's capability to utilize information from knowledge graphs. We conduct experiments with a limited-sample setting on two biomedical question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines."
(6) Enhancing Knowledge Graph Construction Using Large Language Models,https://typeset.io/papers/enhancing-knowledge-graph-construction-using-large-language-3cdx1i3r,"Abstract: The growing trend of Large Language Models (LLM) development has attracted significant attention, with models for various applications emerging consistently. However, the combined application of Large Language Models with semantic technologies for reasoning and inference is still a challenging task. This paper analyzes how the current advances in foundational LLM, like ChatGPT, can be compared with the specialized pretrained models, like REBEL, for joint entity and relation extraction. To evaluate this approach, we conducted several experiments using sustainability-related text as our use case. We created pipelines for the automatic creation of Knowledge Graphs from raw texts, and our findings indicate that using advanced LLM models can improve the accuracy of the process of creating these graphs from unstructured text. Furthermore, we explored the potential of automatic ontology creation using foundation LLM models, which resulted in even more relevant and accurate knowledge graphs."
(7) LLMs Instruct LLMs: An Extraction and Editing Method,https://typeset.io/papers/llms-instruct-llms-an-extraction-and-editing-method-368zsl4kmf,"Abstract: The interest in updating Large Language Models (LLMs) without retraining from scratch is substantial, yet it comes with some challenges.This is especially true for situations demanding complex reasoning with limited samples, a scenario we refer to as the Paucity-Constrained Complex Reasoning Adaptation for LLMs (PCRA-LLM).Traditional methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are inadequate for this critical issue, particularly evident in our exploration of a specific medical context that epitomize the PCRA-LLM's distinct needs.To address the issue, we propose a Sequential Fusion method to incorporate knowledge from complex context into LLMs. This method employs a two-stage framework: initially, it leverages general LLMs to construct knowledge graphs (KGs) for extracting knowledge from complex texts; subsequently, it updates the domain LLMs through knowledge edit. According to our method, the domain LLM achieved a 71.69\% accuracy in question answering tasks. Subsequently, we broadened our assessment to a novel dataset we developed in the economics and management field, where our method realized a 75\% accuracy. These outcomes underline the efficacy and adaptability of our approach for PCRA-LLM across various domains."
(8) Making Large Language Models Perform Better in Knowledge Graph Completion,https://typeset.io/papers/making-large-language-models-perform-better-in-knowledge-3v4vmmkpyj,"Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict the missing triples in the KGs with LLMs and enrich the KGs to become better web infrastructure, which can benefit a lot of web-based automatic services. However, research about LLM-based KGC is limited and lacks effective utilization of LLM's inference capabilities, which ignores the important structural information in KGs and prevents LLMs from acquiring accurate factual knowledge. In this paper, we discuss how to incorporate the helpful KG structural information into the LLMs, aiming to achieve structrual-aware reasoning in the LLMs. We first transfer the existing LLM paradigms to structural-aware settings and further propose a knowledge prefix adapter (KoPA) to fulfill this stated goal. KoPA employs structural embedding pre-training to capture the structural information of entities and relations in the KG. Then KoPA informs the LLMs of the knowledge prefix adapter which projects the structural embeddings into the textual space and obtains virtual knowledge tokens as a prefix of the input prompt. We conduct comprehensive experiments on these structural-aware LLM-based KGC methods and provide an in-depth analysis comparing how the introduction of structural information would be better for LLM's knowledge reasoning ability. Our code is released at https://github.com/zjukg/KoPA."
(9) Evaluating Large Language Models on Graphs: Performance Insights and Comparative Analysis,https://typeset.io/papers/evaluating-large-language-models-on-graphs-performance-4dlkq7gtmo,"Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest within both academic and industrial. Yet, the application of LLMs to graph data remains under-explored. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of four LLMs in addressing several analytical problems with graph data. We employ four distinct evaluation metrics: Comprehension, Correctness, Fidelity, and Rectification. Our results show that: 1) LLMs effectively comprehend graph data in natural language and reason with graph topology. 2) GPT models can generate logical and coherent results, outperforming alternatives in correctness. 3) All examined LLMs face challenges in structural reasoning, with techniques like zero-shot chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting showing diminished efficacy. 4) GPT models often produce erroneous answers in multi-answer tasks, raising concerns in fidelity. 5) GPT models exhibit elevated confidence in their outputs, potentially hindering their rectification capacities. Notably, GPT-4 has demonstrated the capacity to rectify responses from GPT-3.5-turbo and its own previous iterations. The code is available at: https://github.com/Ayame1006/LLMtoGraph."
(10) How Big Can It Get? A comparative analysis of LLMs in architecture and scaling,https://typeset.io/papers/how-big-can-it-get-a-comparative-analysis-of-llms-in-4q29hzxjct,"Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming an integral part of our society. They play important roles in education, marketing and healthcare. These models exhibit emergent behavior when scaled, however such scaling might have its disadvantages as well. As a way to combat such disadvantages, new architectures and types of models have been designed. In this paper, we show the different architectural decisions when it comes to building LLMs as well as discuss how big a model needs to be in order to be specialized in a certain area or sector. We show that most specialized models are small in size yet outperform larger models in specific domain tasks."
