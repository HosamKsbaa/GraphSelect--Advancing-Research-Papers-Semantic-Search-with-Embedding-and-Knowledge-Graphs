(1) An optimised deep learning approach for alzheimer’s disease classification,https://typeset.io/papers/an-optimised-deep-learning-approach-for-alzheimers-disease-3qm91htvnl,"Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and incurable brain disorder. It starts out subtly and gets worse with time. 60 to 70 percent of dementia cases are brought on by this illness. An Alzheimer’s patient is diagnosed every two seconds, according to research. The complexity of the brain makes it often very challenging to identify in elderly people. In the area of medical imaging, deep learning is growing. Several deep learning techniques that attempted to identify and categorise the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images into four stages of AD will be compared in this work. 6400 MRI brain images were extracted from a dataset and divided into training, validation, and testing datasets. In our research on twelve deep learning architectures, inceptionV3 has given the best results with 99.56% and 97.75% accuracy on train and validation, respectively, and on test data, the model has achieved an accuracy of 95.81%. We trained the models using optimised ImageNet weights, which resulted in higher accuracy across all twelve models."

This study presents a novel approach aimed at enhancing AD diagnosis through the integration of transfer learning, deep learning techniques, and meticulous data preprocessing methodologies. Leveraging a rich dataset from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), comprising MRI scans from both healthy individuals and those with AD, the proposed method seeks to identify subtle abnormalities indicative of the disease. The methodology encompasses several key steps. Initially, MRI data undergoes rigorous cleaning and standardization using histogram equalization to ensure compatibility and remove irrelevant information. Subsequently, a two-step feature extraction process involving an autoencoder neural network is employed to identify significant AD-related features. These features are then combined with other relevant data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the disease. To optimize model efficiency, three algorithms iteratively refine the feature set, focusing on the most informative features associated with AD. Finally, a pretrained deep learning model, VGG19, is fine-tuned using the AD-specific dataset. Results demonstrate a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy post-hyperparameter tuning, with accuracy increasing from 76.5% to 89.5%. The enhanced model performance across various metrics underscores the potential of the proposed approach to revolutionize AD diagnosis, offering promise for earlier detection and more accurate prognostication. This research contributes to advancing the field of neuroimaging-based diagnostic techniques for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's."
(4) Employing transfer learning to optimize deep learning models for Alzheimer’s disease classification using two tau PET tracers,https://typeset.io/papers/employing-transfer-learning-to-optimize-deep-learning-models-3uu6ogjiz2,"Abstract: Abstract Background Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) classification using tau PET data. However, limited sample sizes and unharmonized tau tracers present challenges to developing an agnostic tau tracer tool to predict AD using machine learning. Transfer learning, which leverages pre‐trained models for related tasks, may address these issues. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning in optimizing 3D CNNs for AD classification with distinct cohorts and tau tracers. Method We used tau PET images from ADNI ([ 18 F]Flortaucipir, n = 437) and TRIAD ([ 18 F]MK‐6240, n = 423) cohorts, categorizing patients into CU (cognitively unimpaired) and CI (cognitively impaired). Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were used for tau PET data. Separate 3D CNNs were trained for each tracer, with SUVR volumes as input and diagnosis as output. For transfer learning, we trained a model on [ 18 F]Flortaucipir data with a reduced learning rate, using a pre‐trained model from [ 18 F]MK‐6240. Models underwent 5‐fold cross‐validation, and metrics were computed as the average of validation metrics across folds. To avoid data leakage, images from the same subject were assigned to the same fold. Result The model trained on [ 18 F]MK‐6240 tracer demonstrated higher classification performance than [ 18 F]Flortaucipir (AUC = 0.84 vs 0.67; Figure 1 . F1‐score = 79.77% vs 64.66%; Table 1 ). To enhance the classification performance of [ 18 F]Flortaucipir model, we employed a transfer learning approach by leveraging the model pre‐trained with [ 18 F]MK‐6240. With this approach, we observed a slight improvement in all classification metrics compared to the model trained solely on [ 18 F]Flortaucipir data (AUC = 0.71 vs 0.67; Figure 1 . Accuracy = 71.39% vs 67.72, F1‐score = 67.97% vs 64.66%; Table 1 ). Conclusion This finding highlights the value of transfer learning in optimizing deep learning models for Alzheimer’s disease classification, particularly when handling tau tracers with varying performance levels. Our results are consistent with previous on transfer learning’s effectiveness in this context. These preliminary findings indicate that applying this technique to larger datasets of tau tracers may further enhance model performance, potentially leading to the development of a tau tracer‐agnostic tool that overcomes the need of tracer harmonization for predicting dementia."
(5) A Transfer Learning Approach: Early Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease on US Healthy Aging Dataset,https://typeset.io/papers/a-transfer-learning-approach-early-prediction-of-alzheimers-2whtuk1kt0,"Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a growing public health crisis, a very global health concern, and an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain for which there is still no cure. Globally, it accounts for 60–80% of dementia cases, thereby raising the need for an accurate and effective early classification. The proposed work used a healthy aging dataset from the USA and focused on three transfer learning approaches: VGG16, VGG19, and Alex Net. This work leveraged how the convolutional model and pooling layers work to improve and reduce overfitting, despite challenges in training the numerical dataset. VGG was preferably chosen as a hidden layer as it has a more diverse, deeper, and simpler architecture with better performance when dealing with larger datasets. It consumes less memory and training time. A comparative analysis was performed using machine learning and neural network algorithm techniques. Performance metrics such as accuracy, error rate, precision, recall, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, kappa statistics, ROC, and RMSE were experimented with and compared. The accuracy was 100% for VGG16 and VGG19 and 98.20% for Alex Net. The precision was 99.9% for VGG16, 96.6% for VGG19, and 100% for Alex Net; the recall values were 99.9% for all three cases of VGG16, VGG19, and Alex Net; and the sensitivity metric was 96.8% for VGG16, 97.9% for VGG19, and 98.7% for Alex Net, which has outperformed when compared with the existing approaches for the classification of Alzheimer’s disease. This research contributes to the advancement of predictive knowledge, leading to future empirical evaluation, experimentation, and testing in the biomedical field."
(6) Transfer Learning for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis using EfficientNet-B0 Convolutional Neural Network,https://typeset.io/papers/transfer-learning-for-alzheimer-s-disease-diagnosis-using-2hjlzmew6o,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurological disorder that causes the gradual decline of one's cognitive abilities, and thus, early detection is significant to slow down its deterioration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images have been commonly used to diagnose AD. Furthermore, deep learning techniques such as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are utilized to assist the diagnosis due to the complexity of MRI's analysis. However, CNN models require large datasets for training and have a challenging nature for model optimization. Thus, Transfer Learning, an emerging method that can improve the performance of the deep learning model by eliminating the need for training from scratch, is introduced. This paper will propose a Transfer Learning-based EfficientNet-B0 model to classify MRI brain images for AD diagnosis. The MRI images are obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database; only axial-plane images are used in this study. As a result, the multi-class classification of MRI images into AD, MCI, and NC classes using a Transfer Learning-based model resulted in a training accuracy of 98.93% and a validation accuracy of 87.17%. These results evidenced the significance of Transfer Learning in improving model performance."
(7) Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease from Cranial MRI Images Using Transfer Learning,https://typeset.io/papers/classification-of-alzheimers-disease-from-cranial-mri-images-1u02w2k7v8,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease mostly seen in the elderly affecting memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities. As the incidence of AD is expected to grow in the coming years, early detection is crucial to handle the disease. At present, the primary imaging modality to diagnose an AD is based on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study aims to investigate the diagnostic capacity of convolutional neural network models via transfer learning in the recognition of brain atrophy and neuronal loss depicting AD from cranial MRI scans. Different neural configurations were tested to determine the top-performing model. The top performing model was obtained by ResNet50 with 0.001 learning rate yielding the highest AUC at 93.5, 85% accuracy, 88% recall, 82% specificity, 80% precision and 84% F1-score. The best model was also incorporated to a simple application developed to predict AD. The early and immediate recognition of AD with transfer learning methods can cascade prompt referral to a neurologist or a geriatric medicine physician as well as the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures to mitigate the adverse impact of brain atrophy and to improve the quality of life of AD patients."
(8) Whisper-Based Transfer Learning for Alzheimer Disease Classification: Leveraging Speech Segments with Full Transcripts as Prompts,https://typeset.io/papers/whisper-based-transfer-learning-for-alzheimer-disease-dsto5awuqp,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that can lead to speech impairments. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment, and speech-based diagnosis is currently a hot research topic. In this study, we explore the feasibility of transfer learning for Alzheimer's disease detection using the state-of-the-art multilingual speech recognition and translation model: Whisper. In order to address the limitation of Whisper's narrow perspective caused by the restricted audio segment length during fine-tuning, we propose an innovative method to overcome this problem by using the full transcript as a prompt to assist in training speech segments. This approach results in a relative performance improvement of 9%-12% for models with a higher number of parameters. On the ADReSSo test set, the accuracy and F1 score achieved are 84.51% and 84.50% respectively, surpassing both the baseline system and commonly used speech recognition-language model cascade methods, demonstrating its effectiveness."
