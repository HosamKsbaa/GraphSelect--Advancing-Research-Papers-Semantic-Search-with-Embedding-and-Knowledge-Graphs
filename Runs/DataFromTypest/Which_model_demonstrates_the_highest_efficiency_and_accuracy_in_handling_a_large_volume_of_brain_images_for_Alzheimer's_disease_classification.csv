Early detection is paramount to impede its progression. This study aims to construct an optimized deep learning (DL) framework for early AD detection and classification using magnetic resonance images (MRI) scans. The classification task involves distinguishing between four AD stages: mild demented (MD), very mild demented (VmD), moderate demented (MoD), and non-demented (ND). To achieve effective classification, three DL models (VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50) are implemented and fine-tuned. A systematic evaluation is conducted to optimize hyper-parameters, with extensive experimentation. The results demonstrate superior classification performance of the customized DL models compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, visual geometry group 16 (VGG16) achieves the highest accuracy of 95.85%, followed by ResNet50 with 89.38%, while InceptionV3 yields the lowest accuracy of 87.23%.
