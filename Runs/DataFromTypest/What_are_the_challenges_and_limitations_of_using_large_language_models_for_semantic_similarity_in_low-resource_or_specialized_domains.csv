(1) Large Language Models in Psychiatry: Opportunities and Challenges,https://typeset.io/papers/large-language-models-in-psychiatry-opportunities-and-1edht5vxr8,"Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and respond to freely written text is causing increasing excitement in the field of psychiatry; the application of such models presents unique opportunities and challenges for psychiatric applications. This review article seeks to offer a comprehensive overview of LLMs in psychiatry, their model architecture, potential use cases, and clinical considerations. LLM frameworks such as ChatGPT/GPT-4 are trained on huge amounts of text data that are sometimes fine-tuned for specific tasks. This opens up a wide range of possible psychiatric applications, such as accurately predicting individual patient risk factors for specific disorders, engaging in therapeutic intervention, and analyzing therapeutic material, to name a few. However, adoption in the psychiatric setting presents many challenges, including inherent limitations and biases in LLMs, concerns about explainability and privacy, and the potential damage resulting from produced misinformation. This review covers potential opportunities and limitations and highlights potential considerations when these models are applied in a real-world psychiatric context."
"(2) A Systematic Survey and Critical Review on Evaluating Large Language Models: Challenges, Limitations, and Recommendations",https://typeset.io/papers/a-systematic-survey-and-critical-review-on-evaluating-large-2chn2w4kxn,"Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their remarkable capabilities in performing diverse tasks across various domains. However, a thorough evaluation of these models is crucial before deploying them in real-world applications to ensure they produce reliable performance. Despite the well-established importance of evaluating LLMs in the community, the complexity of the evaluation process has led to varied evaluation setups, causing inconsistencies in findings and interpretations. To address this, we systematically review the primary challenges and limitations causing these inconsistencies and unreliable evaluations in various steps of LLM evaluation. Based on our critical review, we present our perspectives and recommendations to ensure LLM evaluations are reproducible, reliable, and robust."
(3) SimLLM: Calculating Semantic Similarity in Code Summaries using a Large Language Model-Based Approach,https://typeset.io/papers/simllm-calculating-semantic-similarity-in-code-summaries-2sto0l347e,"Abstract: Code summaries are pivotal in software engineering, serving to improve code readability, maintainability, and collaboration. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for automatic code summarization, existing metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as BLEU and BERTScore, have notable limitations. Specifically, these existing metrics either fail to capture the nuances of semantic meaning in summaries or are further limited in understanding domain-specific terminologies and expressions prevalent in code summaries. In this paper, we present SimLLM, a novel LLM-based approach designed to more precisely evaluate the semantic similarity of code summaries. Built upon an autoregressive LLM using a specialized pretraining task on permutated inputs and a pooling-based pairwise similarity measure, SimLLM overcomes the shortcomings of existing metrics. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that SimLLM not only outperforms existing metrics but also shows a significantly high correlation with human ratings."
(4) The limitations of large language models for understanding human language and cognition,https://typeset.io/papers/the-limitations-of-large-language-models-for-understanding-5cayuma6fa,"Abstract: Researchers have recently argued that the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide new insights into longstanding debates about the role of learning and/or innateness in the development and evolution of human language. Here, we argue on two grounds that LLMs alone tell us very little about human language and cognition in terms of acquisition and evolution. First, any similarities between human language and the output of LLMs are purely functional. Borrowing the “four questions” framework from ethology, we argue that what LLMs do is superficially similar, but how they do it is not. In contrast to the rich multimodal data humans leverage in interactive language learning, LLMs rely on immersive exposure to vastly greater quantities of unimodal text data, with recent multimodal efforts built upon mappings between images and text. Second, turning to functional similarities between human language and LLM output, we show that human linguistic behavior is much broader. LLMs were designed to imitate the very specific behavior of human writing; while they do this impressively, the underlying mechanisms of these models limit their capacities for meaning and naturalistic interaction, and their potential for dealing with the diversity in human language. We conclude by emphasising that LLMs are not theories of language, but tools that may be used to study language, and that can only be effectively applied with specific hypotheses to motivate research"
(5) Large Language Models Enhanced Sequential Recommendation for Long-tail User and Item,https://typeset.io/papers/large-language-models-enhanced-sequential-recommendation-for-33swjmto1z,"Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems (SRS) serve the purpose of predicting users' subsequent preferences based on their past interactions and have been applied across various domains such as e-commerce and social networking platforms. However, practical SRS encounters challenges due to the fact that most users engage with only a limited number of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. These challenges, termed as the long-tail user and long-tail item dilemmas, often create obstacles for traditional SRS methods. Mitigating these challenges is crucial as they can significantly impact user satisfaction and business profitability. While some research endeavors have alleviated these issues, they still grapple with issues such as seesaw or noise stemming from the scarcity of interactions. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising avenue to address these challenges from a semantic standpoint. In this study, we introduce the Large Language Models Enhancement framework for Sequential Recommendation (LLM-ESR), which leverages semantic embeddings from LLMs to enhance SRS performance without increasing computational overhead. To combat the long-tail item challenge, we propose a dual-view modeling approach that fuses semantic information from LLMs with collaborative signals from traditional SRS. To address the long-tail user challenge, we introduce a retrieval augmented self-distillation technique to refine user preference representations by incorporating richer interaction data from similar users. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on three authentic datasets using three widely used SRS models, our proposed enhancement framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methodologies."
(6) Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of large language models in answering neurophysiology questions,https://typeset.io/papers/evaluating-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-large-language-5wzdkf05ic,"Abstract: Abstract Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and Anthropic’s Claude, showcase remarkable natural language processing capabilities. Evaluating their proficiency in specialized domains such as neurophysiology is crucial in understanding their utility in research, education, and clinical applications. This study aims to assess and compare the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering neurophysiology questions in both English and Persian (Farsi) covering a range of topics and cognitive levels. Twenty questions covering four topics (general, sensory system, motor system, and integrative) and two cognitive levels (lower-order and higher-order) were posed to the LLMs. Physiologists scored the essay-style answers on a scale of 0–5 points. Statistical analysis compared the scores across different levels such as model, language, topic, and cognitive levels. Performing qualitative analysis identified reasoning gaps. In general, the models demonstrated good performance (mean score = 3.87/5), with no significant difference between language or cognitive levels. The performance was the strongest in the motor system (mean = 4.41) while the weakest was observed in integrative topics (mean = 3.35). Detailed qualitative analysis uncovered deficiencies in reasoning, discerning priorities, and knowledge integrating. This study offers valuable insights into LLMs’ capabilities and limitations in the field of neurophysiology. The models demonstrate proficiency in general questions but face challenges in advanced reasoning and knowledge integration. Targeted training could address gaps in knowledge and causal reasoning. As LLMs evolve, rigorous domain-specific assessments will be crucial for evaluating advancements in their performance."
(7) Large Language Models with Knowledge Domain Partitioning for Specialized Domain Knowledge Concentration,https://typeset.io/papers/large-language-models-with-knowledge-domain-partitioning-for-2jjpnlep3u,"Abstract: Generalized knowledge representation often limits the depth and specificity of responses in large-scale language models, impacting their effectiveness in specialized domains. Knowledge domain partitioning offers a novel and significant approach by dividing the model's knowledge base into distinct, well-defined domains, allowing for concentrated expertise within each area. This study utilizes the Llama model to implement domain-specific modules, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across various domains. The methodology involved architectural modifications and a multi-stage training process, resulting in a model capable of delivering highly relevant and contextually accurate information. The evaluation, based on comprehensive benchmark datasets, highlights the effectiveness of the approach and underscores its potential applications in fields requiring precise and specialized knowledge. The findings contribute to the advancement of domain-specific training strategies, providing a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing the capabilities of large language models in diverse professional and academic contexts."
(8) LlamaTurk: Adapting Open-Source Generative Large Language Models for Low-Resource Language,https://typeset.io/papers/llamaturk-adapting-open-source-generative-large-language-1jro3kcmld,"Abstract: Despite advancements in English-dominant generative large language models, further development is needed for low-resource languages to enhance global accessibility. The primary methods for representing these languages are monolingual and multilingual pretraining. Monolingual pretraining is expensive due to hardware requirements, and multilingual models often have uneven performance across languages. This study explores an alternative solution by adapting large language models, primarily trained on English, to low-resource languages. We assess various strategies, including continual training, instruction fine-tuning, task-specific fine-tuning, and vocabulary extension. The results show that continual training improves language comprehension, as reflected in perplexity scores, and task-specific tuning generally enhances performance of downstream tasks. However, extending the vocabulary shows no substantial benefits. Additionally, while larger models improve task performance with few-shot tuning, multilingual models perform worse than their monolingual counterparts when adapted."
(9) A Review of the Challenges with Massive Web-mined Corpora Used in Large Language Models Pre-Training,https://typeset.io/papers/a-review-of-the-challenges-with-massive-web-mined-corpora-2s0xhvelo5,"Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive review of the challenges associated with using massive web-mined corpora for the pre-training of large language models (LLMs). This review identifies key challenges in this domain, including challenges such as noise (irrelevant or misleading information), duplication of content, the presence of low-quality or incorrect information, biases, and the inclusion of sensitive or personal information in web-mined corpora. Addressing these issues is crucial for the development of accurate, reliable, and ethically responsible language models. Through an examination of current methodologies for data cleaning, pre-processing, bias detection and mitigation, we highlight the gaps in existing approaches and suggest directions for future research. Our discussion aims to catalyze advancements in developing more sophisticated and ethically responsible LLMs."
(10) Bridging the Bosphorus: Advancing Turkish Large Language Models through Strategies for Low-Resource Language Adaptation and Benchmarking,https://typeset.io/papers/bridging-the-bosphorus-advancing-turkish-large-language-4qym2lrwse,"Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming crucial across various fields, emphasizing the urgency for high-quality models in underrepresented languages. This study explores the unique challenges faced by low-resource languages, such as data scarcity, model selection, evaluation, and computational limitations, with a special focus on Turkish. We conduct an in-depth analysis to evaluate the impact of training strategies, model choices, and data availability on the performance of LLMs designed for underrepresented languages. Our approach includes two methodologies: (i) adapting existing LLMs originally pretrained in English to understand Turkish, and (ii) developing a model from the ground up using Turkish pretraining data, both supplemented with supervised fine-tuning on a novel Turkish instruction-tuning dataset aimed at enhancing reasoning capabilities. The relative performance of these methods is evaluated through the creation of a new leaderboard for Turkish LLMs, featuring benchmarks that assess different reasoning and knowledge skills. Furthermore, we conducted experiments on data and model scaling, both during pretraining and fine-tuning, simultaneously emphasizing the capacity for knowledge transfer across languages and addressing the challenges of catastrophic forgetting encountered during fine-tuning on a different language. Our goal is to offer a detailed guide for advancing the LLM framework in low-resource linguistic contexts, thereby making natural language processing (NLP) benefits more globally accessible."
