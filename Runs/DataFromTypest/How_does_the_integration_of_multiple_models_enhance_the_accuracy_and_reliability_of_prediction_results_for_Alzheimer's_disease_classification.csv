In this context, knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a pivotal tool in biomedical research, offering new perspectives on drug repurposing and biomarker discovery by analyzing intricate network structures. Our study seeks to build an AD-specific knowledge graph, highlighting interactions among AD, genes, variants, chemicals, drugs, and other diseases. The goal is to shed light on existing treatments, potential targets, and diagnostic methods for AD, thereby aiding in drug repurposing and the identification of biomarkers. Results: We annotated 800 PubMed abstracts and leveraged GPT-4 for text augmentation to enrich our training data for named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification. A comprehensive data mining model, integrating NER and relationship classification, was trained on the annotated corpus. This model was subsequently applied to extract relation triplets from unannotated abstracts. To enhance entity linking, we utilized a suite of reference biomedical databases and refine the linking accuracy through abbreviation resolution. As a result, we successfully identified 3,199,276 entity mentions and 633,733 triplets, elucidating connections between 5,000 unique entities. These connections were pivotal in constructing a comprehensive Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Graph (ADKG). We also integrated the ADKG constructed after entity linking with other biomedical databases. The ADKG served as a training ground for Knowledge Graph Embedding models with the high-ranking predicted triplets supported by evidence, underscoring the utility of ADKG in generating testable scientific hypotheses. Further application of ADKG in predictive modeling using the UK Biobank data revealed models based on ADKG outperforming others, as evidenced by higher values in the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

Multimodal fusion of complementary biomarkers may improve diagnostic performance. This study proposes a multimodal machine learning framework integrating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays for enhanced AD characterization. The model incorporates a hybrid algorithm combining enhanced Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm referred to as ILHHO, with Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) classifier for simultaneous feature selection and classification.

Comparative analysis with other improved HHO algorithms, classic meta-heuristic algorithms (MHAs), and state-of-the-art MHAs on IEEE CEC2014 benchmark functions indicates that ILHHO achieves superior optimization performance compared to other comparative algorithms. The synergistic ILHHO-KELM model is evaluated on 202 AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects. Results demonstrate superior multimodal classification accuracy over single modalities, validating the importance of fusing heterogeneous biomarkers. MRI + PET + CSF achieves 99.2 % accuracy for AD vs. normal control (NC), outperforming conventional and proposed methods. Discriminative feature analysis provides further insights into differential AD-related neurodegeneration patterns detected by MRI and PET. The differential PET and MRI features demonstrate how the two modalities provide complementary biomarkers. The neuroanatomical relevance of selected features supports ILHHO-KELM's potential for extracting sensitive AD imaging signatures. Overall, the study showcases the advantages of capitalizing on complementary multimodal data through advanced feature learning techniques for improving AD diagnosis."
