(1) Enhancing Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Accuracy through an Ensemble Machine Learning Approach,https://typeset.io/papers/enhancing-cardiovascular-disease-prediction-accuracy-through-2x166o7pj1,"Abstract: This study explores the efficacy of an ensemble machine learning approach, specifically a Voting Classifier combining Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers, in predicting cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Utilizing a dataset consisting of 70,000 clinical records, the model was rigorously tested through 5-fold cross-validation, achieving remarkable results with average accuracies, precision, recall, and F1-scores all exceeding 99%. The findings validate the hypothesis that ensemble models, due to their capacity to leverage multiple learning algorithms, provide superior prediction accuracy and reliability compared to single predictor models. This research not only confirms the effectiveness of ensemble methods in medical diagnostics but also highlights their potential to enhance decision-making in clinical settings. Given the model's success in identifying various stages of cardiovascular conditions with high accuracy, it offers significant implications for early intervention and personalized patient management. Future research should aim to validate these results across more diverse populations and explore the integration of additional predictive factors that could refine the model's applicability. This study contributes to the computational health field by demonstrating how advanced machine learning techniques can be effectively applied in predicting health outcomes."
(2) A step toward the detection of alzheimer's disease using ensemble learning,https://typeset.io/papers/a-step-toward-the-detection-of-alzheimer-s-disease-using-3wwrqvm1h1,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a congenital, radical nervous brain disorder. Early discovery of Alzheimer's disease can help avoid injury to brain tissues and assist with proper treatment. Ensemble learning uses various algorithms to achieve higher prediction accuracy than any of the algorithms themselves. Scholars have begun to combine these technologies for different purposes with the growing popularity of in-depth learning technologies. In this research work, we propose an approach of profound learning as a method for combining algorithms for the classification of Alzheimer's disease. We ensemble three models ResNet-50, DensNet-121, and VGG19; these models have not been used before as an ensemble model. When combining multiple base learning models for final magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image organization, the ensemble approaches of majority voting and stacking are studied for their effectiveness. In terms of correct cataloging for Alzheimer's detection, the ensemble classifier achieves the greatest results, with the precision of the suggested model 96%, recall 95%, F1-score 94%, and overall accuracy 90.15%, for the best performance. In addition, the results reveal that the ensemble classifier outdoes the single learning model by a large margin, demonstrating that the suggested approach is both successful and efficient. In the future, we will add multimodalities to this ensemble model, and we will also work on the performance of this model."
(3) [An ensemble model for assisting early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis based on structural magnetic resonance imaging with dual-time-point fusion].,https://typeset.io/papers/an-ensemble-model-for-assisting-early-alzheimer-s-disease-1aqecp0luo,"Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Due to the subtlety of symptoms in the early stages of AD, rapid and accurate clinical diagnosis is challenging, leading to a high rate of misdiagnosis. Current research on early diagnosis of AD has not sufficiently focused on tracking the progression of the disease over an extended period in subjects. To address this issue, this paper proposes an ensemble model for assisting early diagnosis of AD that combines structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data from two time points with clinical information. The model employs a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3DCNN) and twin neural network modules to extract features from the sMRI data of subjects at two time points, while a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used to model the clinical information of the subjects. The objective is to extract AD-related features from the multi-modal data of the subjects as much as possible, thereby enhancing the diagnostic performance of the ensemble model. Experimental results show that based on this model, the classification accuracy rate is 89% for differentiating AD patients from normal controls (NC), 88% for differentiating mild cognitive impairment converting to AD (MCIc) from NC, and 69% for distinguishing non-converting mild cognitive impairment (MCInc) from MCIc, confirming the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for early diagnosis of AD, as well as its potential to play a supportive role in the clinical diagnosis of early Alzheimer's disease."
(4) An Ensemble Classification Model to Predict Alzheimer’s Incidence as Multiple Classes,https://typeset.io/papers/an-ensemble-classification-model-to-predict-alzheimers-4m56ey4k94,"Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble classification model designed to categorize Alzheimer’s disease (AD) into four distinct classes—mild dementia, no dementia, moderate dementia, and very mild dementia—using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The proposed model entitled the Ensemble Classification Model to Predict Alzheimer's Incidence as Multiple Classes (PAIMC) that integrates a six-dimensional analysis of MR images, encompassing entropies, Fractal Dimensions, Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), morphological features, and Local Binary Patterns. A four-fold multi-label cross-validation approach was employed on a benchmark dataset to evaluate the model's performance. Quantitative analysis reveals that PAIMC consistently achieves superior Decision Accuracy, F-Score, Specificity, Sensitivity Recall, and Precision metrics compared to existing state-of-the-art models. For instance, PAIMC's Decision Accuracy and Precision outperform the second-best model by a notable margin across all folds. The model also demonstrates a significant improvement in Sensitivity Recall and Specificity, reinforcing its efficacy in the multi-class classification of AD stages. A novel data diversity assessment measure was developed and utilized, further confirming the robustness of the PAIMC model. The results underscore the potential of PAIMC as a highly accurate tool for AD classification in clinical settings."
(5) Harmonic Symphony of Prediction: Unveiling a Melodic Ensemble Model for Alzheimer's Disease Prophecy,https://typeset.io/papers/harmonic-symphony-of-prediction-unveiling-a-melodic-ensemble-2osyzhpqxl,"Abstract: One neurodegenerative illness that presents a serious threat to world health is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prompt and precise AD prediction is essential for prompt intervention and better patient outcomes. In this study, we provide an ensemble model that forecasts this disease by using the advantages of three powerful machine learning algorithms: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The ensemble model combines these algorithms' various forecasting powers to improve performance. The ensemble architecture aims to maximize each model's unique strengths while limiting overfitting risk and making up for any shortcomings. In addition, we dissect each algorithm's unique contribution within the ensemble to reveal their synergistic benefits. The results reveal that our technique is successful in predicting Alzheimer's disease, with an amazing 92% accuracy rate. In addition to achieving high accuracy, the suggested ensemble model demonstrates resilience and interpretability, two qualities that are essential for the clinical use of predictive models. In pursuing better patient care, our research highlights the promise of combined modeling as a viable means of raising the preciseness of Alzheimer's illness prediction and opening the door to early identification and intervention."
(6) Alzheimer's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Model,https://typeset.io/papers/alzheimer-s-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning-model-isdogl3ba5,"Abstract: Machine Learning combining predictions from multiple algorithms (e.g., Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM) with a voting classifier, is the process known as ensemble learning techniques. The ensemble assesses performance measures on the training dataset, such as accuracy scores, ROC curves, and classification reports, using cross-validation and both soft and hard voting techniques. Using a range of classifiers aims to capture different features of the data and increase the overall predicted accuracy. The versatility of the code is demonstrated with an XGBoost classifier that has been commented out, which leaves room for further customisation and experimentation. Ensemble learning technique also functions as a potent tool for improving model correctness and reliability, with comprehensive evaluation metrics facilitating informed model selection and decision-making. This ensemble strategy aims to increase the model's overall prediction power by using the unique capabilities of each classifier."
(7) Introducing an ensemble method for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease through the analysis of PET scan images,https://typeset.io/papers/introducing-an-ensemble-method-for-the-early-detection-of-17k6xrunc3,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects cognitive functions such as memory, thinking, and behavior. In this disease, there is a critical phase, mild cognitive impairment, that is really important to be diagnosed early since some patients with progressive MCI will develop the disease. This study delves into the challenging task of classifying Alzheimer's disease into four distinct groups: control normal (CN), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI), stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This classification is based on a thorough examination of PET scan images obtained from the ADNI dataset, which provides a thorough understanding of the disease's progression. Several deep-learning and traditional machine-learning models have been used to detect Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, three deep-learning models, namely VGG16 and AlexNet, and a custom Convolutional neural network (CNN) with 8-fold cross-validation have been used for classification. Finally, an ensemble technique is used to improve the overall result of these models. The results show that using deep-learning models to tell the difference between MCI patients gives an overall average accuracy of 93.13% and an AUC of 94.4%."
(8) Improving Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis on Brain MRI Scans with an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models,https://typeset.io/papers/improving-alzheimer-s-disease-diagnosis-on-brain-mri-scans-54ik4xfw5o,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurolog-ical condition affecting millions globally. It gradually advances, leading to memory loss, cognitive deterioration, and a substantial decline in overall quality of life for those affected. AD patients experience memory decline, eroding cherished memories and straining relationships, while daily tasks become challenging. Numerous investigations have been conducted in this field, as the timely identification of Alzheimer's disease at its initial stage is of the utmost importance. A major limitation in this field is the predominant emphasis on using single fine-tuned CNN architecture or comparing pre-trained and custom CNN models for Alzheimer's detection, often on small datasets, which neglects a more comprehensive approach. Using smaller datasets can negatively impact deep learning modeling accuracy due to overfitting, limited representation, and poor generalization. This study addresses the current research problems and proposes an ensemble approach that combines predictions from various pre-trained models, including DenseNet-121, EfficientNet B7, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and also from a Custom CNN. The model averaging ensemble method was applied, a subset of the Stacking Ensemble, to two ADNI datasets, with Dataset-I being the larger. The goal was to assess the efficacy of this ensemble approach for accurate multiclass classification on ADNI datasets, where it successfully identified all classes despite differing sample volumes. A vast experiment was conducted on two distinct and widely recognized real-world datasets, resulting in accuracies of 99.96% and 98.90% respectively. Finally, the outcome of the research compared with recent research findings demonstrates the potential of our approach in advancing Alzheimer's disease detection by outperforming other benchmark approaches by a significant margin."
(9) Ensemble learning-based multimodal data analysis improving the diagnostic accuracy of Alzheimer's disease,https://typeset.io/papers/ensemble-learning-based-multimodal-data-analysis-improving-454xedfndr,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, whose early diagnosis is crucial for disease control and treatment. This study aims to explore the use of ensemble learning to analyze data from AD patients using multimodal inputs, including MRI image features extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNN), age, gender, APOE status and clinical functional scales. Firstly, we preprocess and extract the key image information features related to AD from MRI images. We then used multiple machine learning (ML) methods to build different classifiers, and combined these different classifiers by voting to obtain more accurate prediction results. Our method has been validated on a large AD patient database.The results demonstrated that the analysis of multimodal data can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of AD compared to single-mode data, while ensemble learning further improves the stability of the model."
(10) Identifying Biomarker of Alzheimer's Disease Based on an Extensible Ensemble Learning Model,https://typeset.io/papers/identifying-biomarker-of-alzheimer-s-disease-based-on-an-4tq38auej7,"Abstract: Using neural network to study the potential relationship between brain genetics and imaging has become an effective method to understand the neurodegenerative disease. At present, for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, researchers are increasingly focusing on potential relationship between different modal data rather than just focusing on a single modal data. However, multi-modal data often has the characteristics of few samples and high dimensions. To solve this problem, the existing genetic evolution random neural network cluster (GERNNC) model uses Pearson correlation analysis to construct the fusion characteristics of brain regions and genes, and combines genetic evolution algorithm and neural network to classify AD patients and extract pathogenic factors. However, due to the limitation of early fusion methods to fuse multi-modal data in this model, it is difficult for the model to freely increase the input multi-modal data. In addition, because the model integrates a large number of random neural network, the stability of the model is inadequate. In order to solve the above two problems, this article improves the multi-modal fusion method, model framework and algorithm in the GERNNC model, and proposes an improved genetic evolution random neural network cluster (IGERNNC) model. The IGERNNC model uses a late fusion method, using multiple parallel GERNNCs to train multimodal data simultaneously, and fusing the training results to allow the model to freely add data from other modalities. In addition, in order to further improve the connection between different modalities, this article proposes a feedback mechanism and a ‘forced selection’ method for the IGERNNC model to enhance the stability. Through several independent experiments, IGERNNC model can more effectively identify AD patients and extract relevant pathogenic factors, which provides a theoretical basis for further understanding complex pathology of neurodegenerative diseases."
