(1) A Transfer Learning Approach: Early Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease on US Healthy Aging Dataset,https://typeset.io/papers/a-transfer-learning-approach-early-prediction-of-alzheimers-2whtuk1kt0,"Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a growing public health crisis, a very global health concern, and an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain for which there is still no cure. Globally, it accounts for 60–80% of dementia cases, thereby raising the need for an accurate and effective early classification. The proposed work used a healthy aging dataset from the USA and focused on three transfer learning approaches: VGG16, VGG19, and Alex Net. This work leveraged how the convolutional model and pooling layers work to improve and reduce overfitting, despite challenges in training the numerical dataset. VGG was preferably chosen as a hidden layer as it has a more diverse, deeper, and simpler architecture with better performance when dealing with larger datasets. It consumes less memory and training time. A comparative analysis was performed using machine learning and neural network algorithm techniques. Performance metrics such as accuracy, error rate, precision, recall, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, kappa statistics, ROC, and RMSE were experimented with and compared. The accuracy was 100% for VGG16 and VGG19 and 98.20% for Alex Net. The precision was 99.9% for VGG16, 96.6% for VGG19, and 100% for Alex Net; the recall values were 99.9% for all three cases of VGG16, VGG19, and Alex Net; and the sensitivity metric was 96.8% for VGG16, 97.9% for VGG19, and 98.7% for Alex Net, which has outperformed when compared with the existing approaches for the classification of Alzheimer’s disease. This research contributes to the advancement of predictive knowledge, leading to future empirical evaluation, experimentation, and testing in the biomedical field."

(3) Advancing Alzheimer's Diagnosis Through Transfer Learning with Deep MRI Analysis,https://typeset.io/papers/advancing-alzheimer-s-diagnosis-through-transfer-learning-5evv3uzqq2,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant health-care challenge, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis for effective management. This study presents a novel approach aimed at enhancing AD diagnosis through the integration of transfer learning, deep learning techniques, and meticulous data preprocessing methodologies. Leveraging a rich dataset from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), comprising MRI scans from both healthy individuals and those with AD, the proposed method seeks to identify subtle abnormalities indicative of the disease. The methodology encompasses several key steps. Initially, MRI data undergoes rigorous cleaning and standardization using histogram equalization to ensure compatibility and remove irrelevant information.

Thus, it is essential to look at new methods for early disease detection that need the least amount of human intervention. Radiomics is a relatively new field of study that involves turning the features and information found in medical images into quantifiable data and then mining that data to provide better decision support. The goal of this work is to highlight how important radiomics provides in the various classifications of Alzheimer's stages by applying machine learning and transfer learning models using MRI data which can help in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's.

(5) Enhancing Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection: Leveraging Pre-trained Networks and Transfer Learning,https://typeset.io/papers/enhancing-early-alzheimer-s-disease-detection-leveraging-pre-2ckq6esxx3,"Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. Early and accurate AD detection is crucial for timely intervention and improving patient outcomes. Lately, there have been notable advancements in using deep learning approaches to classify neuroimaging data associated with Alzheimer's disease. These methods have shown substantial progress in achieving accurate classification results. Nevertheless, the concept of end-to-end learning, which has the potential to harness the benefits of deep learning fully, has yet to garner extensive focus in the realm of neuroimaging. This is attributed mainly to the persistent challenge in neuroimaging, namely the limited data availability. This study employs neuroimages and Transfer Learning (TL) to identify early signs of AD and different phases of cognitive impairment. By employing transfer learning, the study uses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) database to classify images into various categories, such as Cognitively Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The classification task involves training and testing three pre-trained networks: VGG-19, ResNet-50, and Inception V3. The study evaluates the performance of these networks using the confusion matrix and its associated metrics. Among the three models, ResNet-50 achieves the highest recall rate of 99.25%, making it more efficient in detecting the early stages of AD development. The study further examines the performance of the pre-trained networks on a class-by-class basis using the parameters derived from the confusion matrix. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into how each model performs for different classes within the AD classification framework. Overall, the research underscores the potential of deep learning and transfer learning in advancing early AD detection and emphasizes the significance of utilizing pre-trained models for this purpose."
(6) Transfer Learning for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis using EfficientNet-B0 Convolutional Neural Network,https://typeset.io/papers/transfer-learning-for-alzheimer-s-disease-diagnosis-using-2hjlzmew6o,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurological disorder that causes the gradual decline of one's cognitive abilities, and thus, early detection is significant to slow down its deterioration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images have been commonly used to diagnose AD. Furthermore, deep learning techniques such as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are utilized to assist the diagnosis due to the complexity of MRI's analysis. However, CNN models require large datasets for training and have a challenging nature for model optimization. Thus, Transfer Learning, an emerging method that can improve the performance of the deep learning model by eliminating the need for training from scratch, is introduced. This paper will propose a Transfer Learning-based EfficientNet-B0 model to classify MRI brain images for AD diagnosis. The MRI images are obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database; only axial-plane images are used in this study. As a result, the multi-class classification of MRI images into AD, MCI, and NC classes using a Transfer Learning-based model resulted in a training accuracy of 98.93% and a validation accuracy of 87.17%. These results evidenced the significance of Transfer Learning in improving model performance."
(7) Employing transfer learning to optimize deep learning models for Alzheimer’s disease classification using two tau PET tracers,https://typeset.io/papers/employing-transfer-learning-to-optimize-deep-learning-models-3uu6ogjiz2,"Abstract: Abstract Background Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) classification using tau PET data. However, limited sample sizes and unharmonized tau tracers present challenges to developing an agnostic tau tracer tool to predict AD using machine learning. Transfer learning, which leverages pre‐trained models for related tasks, may address these issues. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning in optimizing 3D CNNs for AD classification with distinct cohorts and tau tracers. Method We used tau PET images from ADNI ([ 18 F]Flortaucipir, n = 437) and TRIAD ([ 18 F]MK‐6240, n = 423) cohorts, categorizing patients into CU (cognitively unimpaired) and CI (cognitively impaired). Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were used for tau PET data. Separate 3D CNNs were trained for each tracer, with SUVR volumes as input and diagnosis as output. For transfer learning, we trained a model on [ 18 F]Flortaucipir data with a reduced learning rate, using a pre‐trained model from [ 18 F]MK‐6240. Models underwent 5‐fold cross‐validation, and metrics were computed as the average of validation metrics across folds. To avoid data leakage, images from the same subject were assigned to the same fold. Result The model trained on [ 18 F]MK‐6240 tracer demonstrated higher classification performance than [ 18 F]Flortaucipir (AUC = 0.84 vs 0.67; Figure 1 . F1‐score = 79.77% vs 64.66%; Table 1 ). To enhance the classification performance of [ 18 F]Flortaucipir model, we employed a transfer learning approach by leveraging the model pre‐trained with [ 18 F]MK‐6240. With this approach, we observed a slight improvement in all classification metrics compared to the model trained solely on [ 18 F]Flortaucipir data (AUC = 0.71 vs 0.67; Figure 1 . Accuracy = 71.39% vs 67.72, F1‐score = 67.97% vs 64.66%; Table 1 ). Conclusion This finding highlights the value of transfer learning in optimizing deep learning models for Alzheimer’s disease classification, particularly when handling tau tracers with varying performance levels. Our results are consistent with previous on transfer learning’s effectiveness in this context. These preliminary findings indicate that applying this technique to larger datasets of tau tracers may further enhance model performance, potentially leading to the development of a tau tracer‐agnostic tool that overcomes the need of tracer harmonization for predicting dementia."
(8) Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease from Cranial MRI Images Using Transfer Learning,https://typeset.io/papers/classification-of-alzheimers-disease-from-cranial-mri-images-1u02w2k7v8,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease mostly seen in the elderly affecting memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities. As the incidence of AD is expected to grow in the coming years, early detection is crucial to handle the disease. At present, the primary imaging modality to diagnose an AD is based on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study aims to investigate the diagnostic capacity of convolutional neural network models via transfer learning in the recognition of brain atrophy and neuronal loss depicting AD from cranial MRI scans. Different neural configurations were tested to determine the top-performing model. The top performing model was obtained by ResNet50 with 0.001 learning rate yielding the highest AUC at 93.5, 85% accuracy, 88% recall, 82% specificity, 80% precision and 84% F1-score. The best model was also incorporated to a simple application developed to predict AD. The early and immediate recognition of AD with transfer learning methods can cascade prompt referral to a neurologist or a geriatric medicine physician as well as the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures to mitigate the adverse impact of brain atrophy and to improve the quality of life of AD patients."
(9) Multi-Class Alzheimer's Disease Classification Using a Fine-Tuned InceptionV3 Pretrained Model: A Step Towards Diagnosis and Prediction,https://typeset.io/papers/multi-class-alzheimer-s-disease-classification-using-a-fine-2qmqx7ywn9,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative neurologic condition that results in brain shrinkage and neuronal death. The most prevalent kind of memory loss also known as dementia, Alzheimer's disease gradually deteriorates thinking and social connections by damaging the brain cells. To facilitate early identification of Alzheimer's disease using brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging, it is important to design an automated method for the identification and classification of this disease. This system ought to have the capability to accurately identify and categorize individuals who exhibit symptoms of dementia. This work is focused on applying the technique of transfer learning by implication of segmented MRI images of the brain for detecting cognitive dysfunction as well as Alzheimer's disease at initial and different stages. This technique involves fine-tuning a convolutional network that has already been trained, specifically InceptionV3 for the classification of the segmented brain images. Alzheimer's dataset, which includes various images of the brain for four different stages of Alzheimer's, has been employed for effective training and testing of the proposed framework. The model displays great accuracy outcomes in categorizing the MRI images of 96.01% with a very low loss of 0.27 along with training accuracy of 96.41% with a loss of 0.24. This research can be further utilized in the medical field for diagnosing Alzheimer in its early stages."
(10) Improving Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis on Brain MRI Scans with an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models,https://typeset.io/papers/improving-alzheimer-s-disease-diagnosis-on-brain-mri-scans-54ik4xfw5o,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurolog-ical condition affecting millions globally. It gradually advances, leading to memory loss, cognitive deterioration, and a substantial decline in overall quality of life for those affected. AD patients experience memory decline, eroding cherished memories and straining relationships, while daily tasks become challenging. Numerous investigations have been conducted in this field, as the timely identification of Alzheimer's disease at its initial stage is of the utmost importance. A major limitation in this field is the predominant emphasis on using single fine-tuned CNN architecture or comparing pre-trained and custom CNN models for Alzheimer's detection, often on small datasets, which neglects a more comprehensive approach. Using smaller datasets can negatively impact deep learning modeling accuracy due to overfitting, limited representation, and poor generalization. This study addresses the current research problems and proposes an ensemble approach that combines predictions from various pre-trained models, including DenseNet-121, EfficientNet B7, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and also from a Custom CNN. The model averaging ensemble method was applied, a subset of the Stacking Ensemble, to two ADNI datasets, with Dataset-I being the larger. The goal was to assess the efficacy of this ensemble approach for accurate multiclass classification on ADNI datasets, where it successfully identified all classes despite differing sample volumes. A vast experiment was conducted on two distinct and widely recognized real-world datasets, resulting in accuracies of 99.96% and 98.90% respectively. Finally, the outcome of the research compared with recent research findings demonstrates the potential of our approach in advancing Alzheimer's disease detection by outperforming other benchmark approaches by a significant margin."
