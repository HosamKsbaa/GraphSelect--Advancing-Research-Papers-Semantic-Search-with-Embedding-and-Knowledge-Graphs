(2) A Comparative Study on Data Balancing Methods for Alzheimer's Disease Classification,https://typeset.io/papers/a-comparative-study-on-data-balancing-methods-for-alzheimer-1d74k537jx,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting millions of people worldwide, often associated with the aging process, leading to the death of nerve cells in the brain and loss of connections. Recently, promising results have been demonstrated in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using deep learning models, and various approaches for early diagnosis have been proposed. However, the imbalance in health datasets, particularly those containing rare cases, can lead to performance losses and misleading results during model training. This study focuses on these imbalance issues, evaluating the effectiveness of different balancing methods using the Alzheimer's MRI dataset. In this context, the performance of SMOTE, ADASYN, and Weight Balancing methods is compared using a custom model. Experimental results indicate that, compared to the original imbalanced dataset, Weight balancing outperforms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. While SMOTE and ADASYN show improvement in various metrics, they are considered inferior to the Weight Balancing method. This study contributes to selecting data-balancing methods to enhance the accuracy of deep learning models in Alzheimer's disease classification and emphasizes the importance of addressing class imbalances in health datasets."
(3) Improved neural network with multi-task learning for Alzheimer's disease classification,https://typeset.io/papers/improved-neural-network-with-multi-task-learning-for-e4cnqmlohu,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease(AD) poses a significant challenge due to its widespread prevalence and the lack of effective treatments, highlighting the urgent need for early detection. This research introduces an enhanced neural network, named ADnet, which is based on the VGG16 model, to detect Alzheimer's disease using two-dimensional MRI slices. ADNet incorporates several key improvements: it replaces traditional convolution with depthwise separable convolution to reduce model parameters, replaces the ReLU activation function with ELU to address potential issues with exploding gradients, and integrates the SE(Squeeze-and-Excitation) module to enhance feature extraction efficiency. In addition to the primary task of MRI feature extraction, ADnet is simultaneously trained on two auxiliary tasks: clinical dementia score regression and mental state score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the baseline VGG16, ADNet achieves a 4.18% accuracy improvement for AD vs. CN classification and a 6% improvement for MCI vs. CN classification. These findings highlight the effectiveness of ADnet in classifying Alzheimer's disease, providing crucial support for early diagnosis and intervention by medical professionals. The proposed enhancements represent advancements in neural network architecture and training strategies for improved AD classification."
(4) Alzheimer Disease Classification Using Improved VGG 19 Architecture,https://typeset.io/papers/alzheimer-disease-classification-using-improved-vgg-19-376vaa2yjk,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and may cause irreversible damage to memory cells. Numerous long-term effects emerge as Alzheimer's progresses. Because of this, it is essential to detect the condition as soon as possible. Accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease is the primary subject of this investigation.

(6) Improving the Accuracy of Deep Learning Models for Alzheimer’s Disease Classification Trained on Very Small Training Sets Using Topological Data Analysis,https://typeset.io/papers/improving-the-accuracy-of-deep-learning-models-for-2i8keor2lf,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pernicious brain degeneration which has a very steady growth rate. There are many deep learning models that have done AD classification using neuroimaging data, but their performance is related to large datasets, which are very costly and rare to obtain. This paper proposes a novel approach to raise the accuracy of the deep learning models for classification when trained using small training sets, leveraging the power of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). However, applications of TDA to image classification is very unpopular. This study applies TDA to Alzheimer's disease classification and shows that a deep learning model with TDA notably refines the model's accuracy if the training set at hand is very small."
(7) Improved Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease With Convolutional Neural Networks,https://typeset.io/papers/improved-classification-of-alzheimers-disease-with-1a6tu16unx,"Abstract: This work focuses on classifying MRI images using machine learning models to identify Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, at an early stage [1]. It is now possible to identify and forecast the onset of AD by analyzing brain scans collected through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, classifying patients as either at risk or not. The main goal is to make precise predictions. Improved prediction and detection tools for radiologists, physicians, and caregivers will be made available as a result of the study’s determination of the likelihood that individuals would develop AD and proper categorization of them. Using machine learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and fastai—a user-friendly deep learning library and framework—we developed models using a dataset of 6400 MRI images from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 4 class for the early detection and classification of AD [2]. The models achieve an impressive accuracy rate of 84.4%, with the addition of a pre-trained Visual Geometry Group (VGG) layer to the sequential model, outperforming other algorithms. This study demonstrates a viable method for classifying and diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease early on, utilizing MRI images and machine learning models. The acquired accuracy rates show the models’ potential to assist doctors and other caregivers in AD diagnosis and management, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness."
(8) Convolutional Neural Network Deep Learning Approach for Alzheimer Disease Classification,https://typeset.io/papers/convolutional-neural-network-deep-learning-approach-for-8k73b26jb2,"Abstract: Numerous studies have explored the potential of deep learning (DL) in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). DL models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated their potential in accurately detecting and classifying AD based on various data sources, including brain imaging scans and clinical data. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a brain imaging tool that helps in AD detecting at an early stage and this can help to slow its progression. In this study, we developed and compared two CNN models from scratch for the classification of AD stages. The first model consisted of four convolutional layers, while the second model used five convolutional layers. By examining the results of both models, we aimed to identify the impact of the depth of the CNN architecture on the classification performance. To address the issue of imbalanced datasets, we employed data augmentation techniques. The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models with accuracies of the models of 94.79 and 98.30 respectively. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive comparison between our approaches and state-of-the-art models in the literature that have been used to classify the same dataset. We evaluated the models using various performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure."
(9) Enhancing Multi-Stage Classification of Alzheimer's Disease with Attention Mechanism,https://typeset.io/papers/enhancing-multi-stage-classification-of-alzheimer-s-disease-ps7hf11ept,"Abstract: Multi-stage classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) refers to classifying the disease into its multiple stages. Aside from a binary classification task that classifies between the normal control (NC) and AD stages only, an additional prodromal stage known as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is also being classified. MCI is the stage between the healthy subjects known as the NC class, and the patients with heavy symptoms, in the AD class. In other words, MCI subjects only have slight or mild symptoms of Alzheimer's, thus leading it to be a challenge for detection. Classification models usually perform well in binary classification tasks, but not in multistage classification tasks, due to the faint difference in their features. Thus, this research proposes the incorporation of an attention mechanism into the classification model to increase its multi-stage classification performance. The attention mechanism facilitates the classification task by identifying the important features in MRI images so that the model can better differentiate the multiple classes. The MRI data used in this study is obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. The experimental results show that the attention-incorporated model has achieved an improved classification performance as compared to the normal model without attention. The generalizability of the enhanced model is also improved as observed from the training-classification gap results. Hence, the exceptional performance of the attention mechanism positions it as a solution to boost and enhance multi-stage AD classification."
