(1) LLM-based Multi-Level Knowledge Generation for Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion,https://typeset.io/papers/llm-based-multi-level-knowledge-generation-for-few-shot-1nhqwt8jse,"Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are pivotal in various NLP applications but often grapple with incompleteness, especially due to the long-tail problem where infrequent, unpopular relationships drastically reduce the KG completion performance. In this paper, we focus on Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC), a task addressing these gaps in long-tail scenarios. Amidst the rapid evolution of Large Language Models, we propose a generation-based FKGC paradigm facilitated by LLM distillation. Our MuKDC framework employs multi-level knowledge distillation for few-shot KG completion, generating supplementary knowledge to mitigate data scarcity in few-shot environments. MuKDC comprises two primary components: Multi-level Knowledge Generation, which enriches the KG at various levels, and Consistency Assessment, to ensure the coherence and reliability of the generated knowledge. Most notably, our method achieves SOTA results in both FKGC and multi-modal FKGC benchmarks, significantly advancing KG completion and enhancing the understanding and application of LLMs in structured knowledge generation and assessment."
"(2) A Preliminary Roadmap for LLMs as Assistants in Exploring, Analyzing, and Visualizing Knowledge Graphs",https://typeset.io/papers/a-preliminary-roadmap-for-llms-as-assistants-in-exploring-5219q398qy,"Abstract: We present a mixed-methods study to explore how large language models (LLMs) can assist users in the visual exploration and analysis of knowledge graphs (KGs). We surveyed and interviewed 20 professionals from industry, government laboratories, and academia who regularly work with KGs and LLMs, either collaboratively or concurrently. Our findings show that participants overwhelmingly want an LLM to facilitate data retrieval from KGs through joint query construction, to identify interesting relationships in the KG through multi-turn conversation, and to create on-demand visualizations from the KG that enhance their trust in the LLM's outputs. To interact with an LLM, participants strongly prefer a chat-based 'widget,' built on top of their regular analysis workflows, with the ability to guide the LLM using their interactions with a visualization. When viewing an LLM's outputs, participants similarly prefer a combination of annotated visuals (e.g., subgraphs or tables extracted from the KG) alongside summarizing text. However, participants also expressed concerns about an LLM's ability to maintain semantic intent when translating natural language questions into KG queries, the risk of an LLM 'hallucinating' false data from the KG, and the difficulties of engineering a 'perfect prompt.' From the analysis of our interviews, we contribute a preliminary roadmap for the design of LLM-driven knowledge graph exploration systems and outline future opportunities in this emergent design space."
(3) LLMs Are Prone to Fallacies in Causal Inference,https://typeset.io/papers/llms-are-prone-to-fallacies-in-causal-inference-1jpwfbb5mt,"Abstract: Recent work shows that causal facts can be effectively extracted from LLMs through prompting, facilitating the creation of causal graphs for causal inference tasks. However, it is unclear if this success is limited to explicitly-mentioned causal facts in the pretraining data which the model can memorize. Thus, this work investigates: Can LLMs infer causal relations from other relational data in text? To disentangle the role of memorized causal facts vs inferred causal relations, we finetune LLMs on synthetic data containing temporal, spatial and counterfactual relations, and measure whether the LLM can then infer causal relations. We find that: (a) LLMs are susceptible to inferring causal relations from the order of two entity mentions in text (e.g. X mentioned before Y implies X causes Y); (b) if the order is randomized, LLMs still suffer from the post hoc fallacy, i.e. X occurs before Y (temporal relation) implies X causes Y. We also find that while LLMs can correctly deduce the absence of causal relations from temporal and spatial relations, they have difficulty inferring causal relations from counterfactuals, questioning their understanding of causality."
(4) Enhancing knowledge graphs with microdata and LLMs: the case of Schema.org and Wikidata in touristic information,https://typeset.io/papers/enhancing-knowledge-graphs-with-microdata-and-llms-the-case-3fyibi4g7s,"Abstract: Purpose Knowledge graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge bases that represent real-world entities and are used in a variety of applications. Many of them are created and curated from a combination of automated and manual processes. Microdata embedded in Web pages for purposes of facilitating indexing and search engine optimization are a potential source to augment KGs under some assumptions of complementarity and quality that have not been thoroughly explored to date. In that direction, this paper aims to report results on a study that evaluates the potential of using microdata extracted from the Web to augment the large, open and manually curated Wikidata KG for the domain of touristic information. As large corpora of Web text is currently being leveraged via large language models (LLMs), these are used to compare the effectiveness of the microdata enhancement method. Design/methodology/approach The Schema.org taxonomy was used as the source to determine the annotation types to be collected. Here, the authors focused on tourism-related pages as a case study, selecting the relevant Schema.org concepts as point of departure. The large CommonCrawl resource was used to select those annotations from a large recent sample of the World Wide Web. The extracted annotations were processed and matched with Wikidata to estimate the degree to which microdata produced for SEO might become a valuable resource to complement KGs or vice versa. The Web pages themselves can also serve as a context to produce additional metadata elements using them as context in pipelines of an existing LLMs. That way, both the annotations and the contents itself can be used as sources. Findings The samples extracted revealed a concentration of metadata annotations in only a few of the relevant Schema.org attributes and also revealed the possible influence of authoring tools in a significant fraction of microdata produced. The analysis of the overlapping of attributes in the sample with those of Wikidata showed the potential of the technique, limited by the disbalance of the presence of attributes. The combination of those with the use of LLMs to produce additional annotations demonstrates the feasibility of the approach in the population of existing Wikidata locations. However, in both cases, the effectiveness appears to be lower in the cases of less content in the KG, which are arguably the most relevant when considering the scenario of an automated population approach. Originality/value The research reports novel empirical findings on the way touristic annotations with a SEO orientation are being produced in the wild and provides an assessment of their potential to complement KGs, or reuse information from those graphs. It also provides insights on the potential of using LLMs for the task."
(5) AriGraph: Learning Knowledge Graph World Models with Episodic Memory for LLM Agents,https://typeset.io/papers/arigraph-learning-knowledge-graph-world-models-with-episodic-xvgwvwiylh,"Abstract: Advancements in generative AI have broadened the potential applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the development of autonomous agents. Achieving true autonomy requires accumulating and updating knowledge gained from interactions with the environment and effectively utilizing it. Current LLM-based approaches leverage past experiences using a full history of observations, summarization or retrieval augmentation. However, these unstructured memory representations do not facilitate the reasoning and planning essential for complex decision-making. In our study, we introduce AriGraph, a novel method wherein the agent constructs a memory graph that integrates semantic and episodic memories while exploring the environment. This graph structure facilitates efficient associative retrieval of interconnected concepts, relevant to the agent's current state and goals, thus serving as an effective environmental model that enhances the agent's exploratory and planning capabilities. We demonstrate that our Ariadne LLM agent, equipped with this proposed memory architecture augmented with planning and decision-making, effectively handles complex tasks on a zero-shot basis in the TextWorld environment. Our approach markedly outperforms established methods such as full-history, summarization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation in various tasks, including the cooking challenge from the First TextWorld Problems competition and novel tasks like house cleaning and puzzle Treasure Hunting."
(6) Chain of History: Learning and Forecasting with LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion,https://typeset.io/papers/chain-of-history-learning-and-forecasting-with-llms-for-oz21p2sgni,"Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) is a challenging task of predicting missing event links at future timestamps by leveraging established temporal structural knowledge. Given the formidable generative capabilities inherent in LLMs (LLMs), this paper proposes a novel approach to conceptualize temporal link prediction as an event generation task within the context of a historical event chain. We employ efficient fine-tuning methods to make LLMs adapt to specific graph textual information and patterns discovered in temporal timelines. Furthermore, we introduce structure-based historical data augmentation and the integration of reverse knowledge to emphasize LLMs' awareness of structural information, thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We conduct thorough experiments on multiple widely used datasets and find that our fine-tuned model outperforms existing embedding-based models on multiple metrics, achieving SOTA results. We also carry out sufficient ablation experiments to explore the key influencing factors when LLMs perform structured temporal knowledge inference tasks."
(7) An Enhanced Prompt-Based LLM Reasoning Scheme via Knowledge Graph-Integrated Collaboration,https://typeset.io/papers/an-enhanced-prompt-based-llm-reasoning-scheme-via-knowledge-4cayssj0km,"Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in a multitude of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, they encounter challenges in practical applications, including issues with hallucinations, inadequate knowledge updating, and limited transparency in the reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, this study innovatively proposes a collaborative training-free reasoning scheme involving tight cooperation between Knowledge Graph (KG) and LLMs. This scheme first involves using LLMs to iteratively explore KG, selectively retrieving a task-relevant knowledge subgraph to support reasoning. The LLMs are then guided to further combine inherent implicit knowledge to reason on the subgraph while explicitly elucidating the reasoning process. Through such a cooperative approach, our scheme achieves more reliable knowledge-based reasoning and facilitates the tracing of the reasoning results. Experimental results show that our scheme significantly progressed across multiple datasets, notably achieving over a 10% improvement on the QALD10 dataset compared to the best baseline and the fine-tuned state-of-the-art (SOTA) work. Building on this success, this study hopes to offer a valuable reference for future research in the fusion of KG and LLMs, thereby enhancing LLMs' proficiency in solving complex issues."
(8) Knowledge Graphs as Context Sources for LLM-Based Explanations of Learning Recommendations,https://typeset.io/papers/knowledge-graphs-as-context-sources-for-llm-based-1mzezu3na4,"Abstract: In the era of personalized education, the provision of comprehensible explanations for learning recommendations is of a great value to enhance the learner's understanding and engagement with the recommended learning content. Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI in general have recently opened new doors for generating human-like explanations, for and along learning recommendations. However, their precision is still far away from acceptable in a sensitive field like education. To harness the abilities of LLMs, while still ensuring a high level of precision towards the intent of the learners, this paper proposes an approach to utilize knowledge graphs (KG) as a source of factual context, for LLM prompts, reducing the risk of model hallucinations, and safeguarding against wrong or imprecise information, while maintaining an application-intended learning context. We utilize the semantic relations in the knowledge graph to offer curated knowledge about learning recommendations. With domain-experts in the loop, we design the explanation as a textual template, which is filled and completed by the LLM. Domain experts were integrated in the prompt engineering phase as part of a study, to ensure that explanations include information that is relevant to the learner. We evaluate our approach quantitatively using Rouge-N and Rouge-L measures, as well as qualitatively with experts and learners. Our results show an enhanced recall and precision of the generated explanations compared to those generated solely by the GPT model, with a greatly reduced risk of generating imprecise information in the final learning explanation."
(9) Knowledge Graph Enhanced Large Language Model Editing,https://typeset.io/papers/knowledge-graph-enhanced-large-language-model-editing-3rjsknqxqe,"Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are pivotal in advancing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their efficacy is hampered by inaccuracies and outdated knowledge. Model editing emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges. However, existing editing methods struggle to track and incorporate changes in knowledge associated with edits, which limits the generalization ability of postedit LLMs in processing edited knowledge. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel model editing method that leverages knowledge graphs for enhancing LLM editing, namely GLAME. Specifically, we first utilize a knowledge graph augmentation module to uncover associated knowledge that has changed due to editing, obtaining its internal representations within LLMs. This approach allows knowledge alterations within LLMs to be reflected through an external graph structure. Subsequently, we design a graph-based knowledge edit module to integrate structured knowledge into the model editing. This ensures that the updated parameters reflect not only the modifications of the edited knowledge but also the changes in other associated knowledge resulting from the editing process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on GPT-J and GPT-2 XL demonstrate that GLAME significantly improves the generalization capabilities of post-edit LLMs in employing edited knowledge."
