(1) Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Based on Deep Learning Using Medical Images,https://typeset.io/papers/classification-of-alzheimers-disease-based-on-deep-learning-4ixnmh2adj,"Abstract: Neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer’s, pose an escalating global health challenge. Marked by the degeneration of brain neurons, these conditions lead to a gradual decline in nerve cells. Worldwide, over 55 million people grapple with dementia, with Alzheimer’s prominently impacting the aging demographic. The primary hurdle to early Alzheimer’s detection is the widespread lack of awareness. The main goal is to design and implement an artificial intelligence system using deep learning (DL) to detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through medical images and classify them into various stages, such as non-demented, moderate dementia, mild dementia, and very mild dementia. The dataset contains 6400 magnetic resonance images in .jpg format, with standardized dimensions of 176 × 208 pixels. To demonstrate the advantages of data augmentation and transformation techniques, four scenarios were created: two without these techniques, utilizing the Adam and SGD optimizers, and two with these techniques, also employing the Adam and SGD optimizers, respectively. The main results revealed that scenarios utilizing these techniques exhibited more stable performance when validated with a new dataset. Scenario 3, using the Adam optimizer, achieved a weighted average accuracy of 91.83%, whereas scenario 4, employing the SGD optimizer, reached 87.58% accuracy. In contrast, scenarios 1 and 2, which omitted these techniques, obtained low accuracies below 55%. It is concluded that classifying AD with a DL model exceeding 90% accuracy is feasible. This is the importance of utilizing data augmentation and transformation techniques to improve generalizability to input image variations, which is a consistent factor in the healthcare sector."

Initial indications might involve trouble recalling recent happenings, issues with language, and challenges in planning and problem-solving. In this paper, a deep learning-based classification model is proposed which is in turn based on convolutional networks to classify different stages of AD based on 2D axial MRI scans of the brain. To train the model, a publicly available dataset consisting of images corresponding to Normal, Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer's disease classes is utilized.

This disorder substantially hinders an individual's capacity to perform daily activities. Despite ongoing research, identifying the precise cause of AD remains a challenge, and effective treatment options are currently limited. Nevertheless, detecting the condition at an early stage could enhance the well-being of those grappling with Alzheimer's disease.

(5) A Multi-Class Classification Framework with SMOTE Based Data Augmentation Technique for Alzheimer's Disease Progression,https://typeset.io/papers/a-multi-class-classification-framework-with-smote-based-data-4cxkys7jgv,"Abstract: The detection of Alzheimer's disease is a critical task in medical diagnostics due to its rapid progression and profound impact on cognitive function. Deep learning (DL) offers unprecedented capabilities in analyzing medical imaging data, particularly in neuroimaging like MRI scans. However, class imbalances within the dataset persist, making it difficult to discern intricate patterns indicative of Alzheimer's pathology.

(6) Exceptional performance with minimal data using a generative adversarial network for alzheimer's disease classification,https://typeset.io/papers/exceptional-performance-with-minimal-data-using-a-generative-4zn3ffhvfv,"Abstract: Abstract The classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using deep learning models is hindered by the limited availability of data. Medical image datasets are scarce due to stringent regulations on patient privacy, preventing their widespread use in research. Moreover, although open-access databases such as the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) are available publicly for providing medical image data for research, they often suffer from imbalanced classes. Thus, to address the issue of insufficient data, this study proposes the integration of a generative adversarial network (GAN) that can achieve comparable accuracy with a reduced data requirement. GANs are unsupervised deep learning networks commonly used for data augmentation that generate high-quality synthetic data to overcome data scarcity. Experimental data from the OASIS database are used in this research to train the GAN model in generating synthetic MRI data before being included in a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model for multistage AD classification. As a result, this study has demonstrated that a multistage AD classification accuracy above 80% can be achieved even with a reduced dataset. The exceptional performance of GANs positions them as a solution for overcoming the challenge of insufficient data in AD classification."
(7) Advancing Alzheimer's Diagnosis Through Transfer Learning with Deep MRI Analysis,https://typeset.io/papers/advancing-alzheimer-s-diagnosis-through-transfer-learning-5evv3uzqq2,"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant health-care challenge, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis for effective management. This study presents a novel approach aimed at enhancing AD diagnosis through the integration of transfer learning, deep learning techniques, and meticulous data preprocessing methodologies. Leveraging a rich dataset from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), comprising MRI scans from both healthy individuals and those with AD, the proposed method seeks to identify subtle abnormalities indicative of the disease. The methodology encompasses several key steps. Initially, MRI data undergoes rigorous cleaning and standardization using histogram equalization to ensure compatibility and remove irrelevant information. Subsequently, a two-step feature extraction process involving an autoencoder neural network is employed to identify significant AD-related features. These features are then combined with other relevant data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the disease. To optimize model efficiency, three algorithms iteratively refine the feature set, focusing on the most informative features associated with AD. Finally, a pretrained deep learning model, VGG19, is fine-tuned using the AD-specific dataset. Results demonstrate a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy post-hyperparameter tuning, with accuracy increasing from 76.5% to 89.5%. The enhanced model performance across various metrics underscores the potential of the proposed approach to revolutionize AD diagnosis, offering promise for earlier detection and more accurate prognostication. This research contributes to advancing the field of neuroimaging-based diagnostic techniques for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's."
(8) A bilateral filtering-based image enhancement for Alzheimer disease classification using CNN,https://typeset.io/papers/a-bilateral-filtering-based-image-enhancement-for-alzheimer-2vx2g49797,"Abstract: This study aims to develop an optimally performing convolutional neural network to classify Alzheimer’s disease into mild cognitive impairment, normal controls, or Alzheimer’s disease classes using a magnetic resonance imaging dataset. To achieve this, we focused the study on addressing the challenge of image noise, which impacts the performance of deep learning models. The study introduced a scheme for enhancing images to improve the quality of the datasets. Specifically, an image enhancement algorithm based on histogram equalization and bilateral filtering techniques was deployed to reduce noise and enhance the quality of the images. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network model comprising four convolutional layers and two hidden layers was devised for classifying Alzheimer’s disease into three (3) distinct categories, namely mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and normal controls.

The proposed model yielded notable results, such as an accuracy of 93.45% and an area under the curve value of 0.99 when trained on the three classes. The model further showed superior results on binary classification compared with existing methods. The model recorded 94.39%, 94.92%, and 95.62% accuracies for Alzheimer’s disease versus normal controls, Alzheimer’s disease versus mild cognitive impairment, and mild cognitive impairment versus normal controls classes, respectively."
(9) Classification of Alzheimer’s disease using MRI data based on Deep Learning Techniques,https://typeset.io/papers/classification-of-alzheimers-disease-using-mri-data-based-on-2qlumtqnnu,"Abstract: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a worldwide concern impacting millions of people, with no effective treatment known to date. Unlike cancer, which has seen improvement in preventing its progression, early detection remains critical in managing the burden of AD. This paper suggests a novel AD-DL approach for detecting early AD using Deep Learning (DL) Techniques. The dataset consists of pictures of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used to evaluate and validate the suggested model. The method includes stages for pre-processing, DL model training, and evaluation. Five DL models with autonomous feature extraction and binary classification are shown. The models are divided into two categories: without Data Augmentation (without-Aug), which includes CNN-without-AUG, and with Data Augmentation (with-Aug), which includes CNNs-with-Aug, CNNs-LSTM-with-Aug, CNNs-SVM-with-Aug, and Transfer learning using VGG16-SVM-with-Aug. The main goal is to build a model with the best detection accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, training time, and testing time. The dataset is used to evaluate the recommended methodology, showing encouraging results. The experimental results show that CNN-LSTM is superior, with an accuracy percentage of 99.92%. The outcomes of this study lay the groundwork for future DL-based research in AD identification."
(10) Assessing the Potential of Data Augmentation in EEG Functional Connectivity for Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease,https://typeset.io/papers/assessing-the-potential-of-data-augmentation-in-eeg-2zkk9e9pyc,"Abstract: Abstract Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are acquired non-invasively from electrodes placed on the scalp. Experts in the field can use EEG signals to distinguish between patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and normal control (NC) subjects using classification models. However, the training of deep learning or machine learning models requires a large number of trials. Datasets related to Alzheimer’s disease are typically small in size due to the lack of AD patient samples. The lack of data samples required for the training process limits the use of deep learning techniques for further development in clinical settings. We propose to increase the number of trials in the training set by means of a decomposition–recombination system consisting of three steps. Firstly, the original signals from the training set are decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions via multivariate empirical mode decomposition. Next, these intrinsic mode functions are randomly recombined across trials. Finally, the recombined intrinsic mode functions are added together as artificial trials, which are used for training the models. We evaluated the decomposition–recombination system on a small dataset using each subject’s functional connectivity matrices as inputs. Three different neural networks, including ResNet, BrainNet CNN, and EEGNet, were used. Overall, the system helped improve ResNet training in both the mild AD dataset, with an increase of 5.24%, and in the mild cognitive impairment dataset, with an increase of 4.50%. The evaluation of the proposed data augmentation system shows that the performance of neural networks can be improved by enhancing the training set with data augmentation. This work shows the need for data augmentation on the training of neural networks in the case of small-size AD datasets."
