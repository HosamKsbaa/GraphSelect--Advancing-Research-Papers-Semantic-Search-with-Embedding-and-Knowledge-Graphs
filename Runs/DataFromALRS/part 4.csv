In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transfer learning is important for developing strategies that address the variation in MR images from different imaging protocols or scanners. Additionally, transfer learning is beneficial for reutilizing machine learning models that were trained to solve different (but related) tasks to the task of interest. The aim of this review is to identify research directions, gaps in knowledge, applications, and widely used strategies among the transfer learning approaches applied in MR brain imaging; (2) Methods: We performed a systematic literature search for articles that applied transfer learning to MR brain imaging tasks. We screened 433 studies for their relevance, and we categorized and extracted relevant information, including task type, application, availability of labels, and machine learning methods. Furthermore, we closely examined brain MRI-specific transfer learning approaches and other methods that tackled issues relevant to medical imaging, including privacy, unseen target domains, and unlabeled data; (3) Results: We found 129 articles that applied transfer learning to MR brain imaging tasks. The most frequent applications were dementia-related classification tasks and brain tumor segmentation. The majority of articles utilized transfer learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Only a few approaches utilized clearly brain MRI-specific methodology, and considered privacy issues, unseen target domains, or unlabeled data. We proposed a new categorization to group specific, widely-used approaches such as pretraining and fine-tuning CNNs; (4) Discussion: There is increasing interest in transfer learning for brain MRI. Well-known public datasets have clearly contributed to the popularity of Alzheimer’s diagnostics/prognostics and tumor segmentation as applications. Likewise, the availability of pretrained CNNs has promoted their utilization. Finally, the majority of the surveyed studies did not examine in detail the interpretation of their strategies after applying transfer learning, and did not compare their approach with other transfer learning approaches.",0.38335705,0.4283108,0.38587943,0.44311598,0.56792986,0.384165,0.5431147,0.5187936,0.3863067,0.39925733,0.4646855,0.458055,0.3927985,0.3941094,Transfer learning in magnetic resonance brain imaging: A systematic review,4/1/2021,,Juan Miguel Valverde; Vandad Imani; Ali Abdollahzadeh; Riccardo De Feo; Mithilesh Prakash; Robert Ciszek; Jussi Tohka,Journal of Imaging,59,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85108256956&origin=inward,,,,,2021,"@article{,

Manual classification is irreproducible and unreliable. In this study, we aim to develop an automatic classification system of brain images in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (Method) Three datasets were downloaded from the Internet. Those images are of T2-weighted along axial plane with size of 256 × 256. We utilized an s-level decomposition on the basis of dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), in order to obtain 12s ""variance and entropy (VE)"" features from each subband. Afterwards, we used support vector machine (SVM) and its two variants: the generalized eigenvalue proximal SVM (GEPSVM) and the twin SVM (TSVM), as the classifiers. In all, we proposed three novel approaches: DTCWT + VE + SVM, DTCWT + VE + GEPSVM, and DTCWT + VE + TSVM. (Results) The results showed that our ""DTCWT + VE + TSVM"" obtained an average accuracy of 99.57%, which was not only better than the two other proposed methods, but also superior to 12 state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, parameter estimation showed the classification accuracy achieved the largest when the decomposition level s was assigned with a value of 1. Further, we used 100 slices from real subjects, and we found our proposed method was superior to human reports from neuroradiologists.

These images have shown great promise in revealing the altered metabolism patterns in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The AD pathology is progressive, and leads to structural and functional alterations that lie on a continuum. There is a need to quantify the altered metabolism patterns that exist on a continuum into a simple measure. This work proposes a 3D convolutional neural network with residual connections that generates a probability score useful for interpreting the FDG-PET images along the continuum of AD. This network is trained and tested on images of stable normal control and stable Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (sDAT) subjects, achieving an AUC of 0.976 via repeated fivefold cross-validation. An independent test set consisting of images in between the two extreme ends of the DAT spectrum is used to further test the generalization performance of the network. Classification performance of 0.811 AUC is achieved in the task of predicting conversion of mild cognitive impairment to DAT for conversion time of 0–3 years. The saliency and class activation maps, which highlight the regions of the brain that are most important to the classification task, implicate many known regions affected by DAT including the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and hippocampus.",0.52994794,0.54606575,0.5540076,0.5942201,0.5726463,0.500034,0.50851125,0.50459284,0.5351142,0.5690978,0.5646985,0.54100573,0.5824257,0.58584255,Quantifying brain metabolism from FDG-PET images into a probability of Alzheimer's dementia score,1/1/2020,,Evangeline Yee; Karteek Popuri; Mirza Faisal Beg,Human Brain Mapping,36,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072186070&origin=inward,,,,16-May,2020,"@article{,

The efficient management and analysis of these large imaging datasets has prompted research in the field of content-based image retrieval. In this context, our generalized regional disorder-sensitive- weighting (DSW) scheme gives greater weight to brain regions affected by the diseases than regions that are relatively spared. We used two DSW matrices; one matrix is based on the occurrence maps that highlight abnormal functional regions; the other is based on the regional Fisher discriminant ratio.

In three-group classification, the average accuracy is 89.0% for HC, MCI, and AD compared to previous studies using other cortical separation with the best classification accuracy of 81.5%.

In order to automatically and accurately identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at its two levels (early MCI and late MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy control (HC), a novel joint HCP MMP method was first proposed to delineate the cortical architecture and function connectivity in a group of non healthy adults. The proposed method was applied to register a dataset of 96 resting-state functional connectomes from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to Connectivity Informatics Technology Initiative (CIFTI) space and parcellated brain into human connectome project multi-modal parcellation (HCPMMP) with 360 areas.

The statistical deformation model is built by principal component analysis (PCA) on a set of training samples of brain deformation fields that warp a selected template image to the individual brain samples. The statistical deformation model is capable of characterizing individual brain deformations by a small number of parameters, which is used to rapidly estimate the brain deformation between the template and a new individual brain image. The estimated deformation is then used to warp the template, thus generating an intermediate template close to the individual brain image. Finally, the shape difference between the intermediate template and the individual brain is estimated by an image registration algorithm, e.g., HAMMER. The overall registration between the template and the individual brain image can be achieved by directly combining the deformation fields that warp the template to the intermediate template, and the intermediate template to the individual brain image. The algorithm has been validated for spatial normalization of both simulated and real magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images. Compared with HAMMER, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve over five times speedup, with similar registration accuracy and statistical power in detecting brain atrophy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Recent literature suggests that spatial patterns of brain atrophy discriminate amongst Alzheimers disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) older adults with high accuracy on an individual basis, thereby offering promise that subtle brain changes can be detected during prodromal Alzheimers disease stages. Here, we investigate whether these spatial patterns of brain atrophy can be detected in CN and MCI individuals and whether they are associated with cognitive decline. Images from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to construct a pattern classifier that recognizes spatial patterns of brain atrophy which best distinguish Alzheimers disease patients from CN on an individual person basis. This classifier was subsequently applied to longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans of CN and MCI participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) neuroimaging study. The degree to which Alzheimers disease-like patterns were present in CN and MCI subjects was evaluated longitudinally in relation to cognitive performance. The oldest BLSA CN individuals showed progressively increasing Alzheimers disease-like patterns of atrophy, and individuals with these patterns had reduced cognitive performance. MCI was associated with steeper longitudinal increases of Alzheimers disease-like patterns of atrophy, which separated them from CN (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve equal to 0.89). Our results suggest that imaging-based spatial patterns of brain atrophy of Alzheimers disease, evaluated with sophisticated pattern analysis and recognition methods, may be useful in discriminating among CN individuals who are likely to be stable versus those who will show cognitive decline.

It has recently emerged as a powerful way to diagnose Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. However, due to the deficit of recognition memory in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, semantic feature ambiguity, and high inter-class visual similarities problems, computer-aided diagnosis of AD remains challenging. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposed a hippocampus analysis method based on a novel 3D convolutional neural network fusion strategy, called Bidirectional Gated 3D Multi-scale Feature Fusion (BG-3DM2F). The suggested BG-3DM2F framework consists of two modules: 3D Multi-Scale Chained Network (3DMS-ChaineNet) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Fusion Unit (Bi-GRFU). The 3DMS-ChaineNet architecture is introduced to design the subtle features and capture the variations in hippocampal atrophy, while the Bi-GRFU scheme is investigated to store 3DMS-ChaineNet levels in the forward and backward fashion and retain them in the decision-making process. For validation, our solution is completely evaluated on the public Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Practically, we conducted empirical evaluations to verify the effect of BG-3DM2F components. In comparison with the current state-of-the-art methods, the experiments show that our proposed approach provides efficient results, achieving the accuracies of 98.12%, 95.26%, and 96.97% for binary classification of Normal Control (NC) versus AD, AD versus MCI, and NC versus MCI, respectively.

To address this challenge, a novel voxel selection method based on association rule (AR) mining is proposed for designing a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system. The proposed method is tested as a tool for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Discriminant brain areas are selected from a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) databases by means of an AR mining process. Simultaneously activated brain regions in control subjects that consist of the set of voxels defining the antecedents and consequents of the ARs are selected as input voxels for posterior dimensionality reduction. Feature extraction is defined by a subsequent reduction of the selected voxels using principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares (PLS) techniques while classification is performed by a support vector machine (SVM). The proposed method yields an accuracy up to 91.75% (with 89.29% sensitivity and 95.12% specificity) for SPECT and 90% (with 89.33% sensitivity and 90.67% specificity) for PET, thus improving recently developed methods for early diagnosis of AD. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Population differences with complex spatial patterns are then determined by applying a nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) pattern classification method to the morphological signatures. Significant reduction of the dimensionality of the morphological signatures is achieved via wavelet decomposition and feature reduction methods. Applying the method to MR images with simulated atrophy shows that the method can correctly detect subtle and spatially complex atrophy, even when the simulated atrophy represents only a 5% variation from the original image. Applying this method to actual MR images shows that brains can be correctly determined to be male or female with a successful classification rate of 97%, using the leave-one-out method. This proposed method also shows a high classification rate for old adults' age classification, even under difficult test scenarios. The main characteristic of the proposed methodology is that, by applying multivariate pattern classification methods, it can detect subtle and spatially complex patterns of morphological group differences which are often not detectable by voxel-based morphometric methods, because these methods analyze morphological measurements voxel-by-voxel and do not consider the entirety of the data simultaneously. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

However, while the vast majority of these works use the public dataset ADNI for evaluation, they are difficult to reproduce because different key components of the validation are often not readily available. These components include selected participants and input data, image preprocessing and cross-validation procedures. The performance of the different approaches is also difficult to compare objectively. In particular, it is often difficult to assess which part of the method (e.g. preprocessing, feature extraction or classification algorithms) provides a real improvement, if any. In the present paper, we propose a framework for reproducible and objective classification experiments in AD using three publicly available datasets (ADNI, AIBL and OASIS). The framework comprises: i) automatic conversion of the three datasets into a standard format (BIDS); ii) a modular set of preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction and classification methods, together with an evaluation framework, that provide a baseline for benchmarking the different components. We demonstrate the use of the framework for a large-scale evaluation on 1960 participants using T1 MRI and FDG PET data. In this evaluation, we assess the influence of different modalities, preprocessing, feature types (regional or voxel-based features), classifiers, training set sizes and datasets. Performances were in line with the state-of-the-art. FDG PET outperformed T1 MRI for all classification tasks. No difference in performance was found for the use of different atlases, image smoothing, partial volume correction of FDG PET images, or feature type. Linear SVM and L2-logistic regression resulted in similar performance and both outperformed random forests. The classification performance increased along with the number of subjects used for training. Classifiers trained on ADNI generalized well to AIBL and OASIS.

Here, we use a neural network (NN) framework on both magnetic resonance imaging-derived quantitative structural brain measures and genetic data to address this question. We tested the effectiveness of NN models in classifying and predicting AD. We further performed a novel analysis of the NN model to gain insight into the most predictive imaging and genetics features and to identify possible interactions between features that affect AD risk. Data were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative cohort and included baseline structural MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 138 AD patients, 225 CN subjects, and 358 MCI patients. We found that NN models with both brain and SNP features as predictors perform significantly better than models with either alone in classifying AD and CN subjects, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.992, and in predicting the progression from MCI to AD (AUC=0.835). The most important predictors in the NN model were the left middle temporal gyrus volume, the left hippocampus volume, the right entorhinal cortex volume, and the APOE (a gene that encodes apolipoprotein E) ɛ4 risk allele. Furthermore, we identified interactions between the right parahippocampal gyrus and the right lateral occipital gyrus, the right banks of the superior temporal sulcus and the left posterior cingulate, and SNP rs10838725 and the left lateral occipital gyrus.

Here, we used regularized regression approaches with an elastic net penalty for best subset selection of multiregional information from AV45-PET, FDG-PET and volumetric MRI data to predict conversion from MCI to AD. The study sample consisted of 127 MCI subjects from ADNI-2 who had a clinical follow-up between 6 and 31 months. Additional analyses assessed the effect of partial volume correction on predictive performance of AV45- and FDG-PET data. Predictor variables were highly collinear within and across imaging modalities. Penalized Cox regression yielded more parsimonious prediction models compared to unpenalized Cox regression. Within single modalities, time to conversion was best predicted by increased AV45-PET signal in posterior medial and lateral cortical regions, decreased FDG-PET signal in medial temporal and temporobasal regions, and reduced gray matter volume in medial, basal, and lateral temporal regions. Logistic regression models reached up to 72% cross-validated accuracy for prediction of conversion status, which was comparable to cross-validated accuracy of non-linear support vector machine classification. Regularized regression outperformed unpenalized stepwise regression when number of parameters approached or exceeded the number of training cases. Partial volume correction had a negative effect on the predictive performance of AV45-PET, but slightly improved the predictive value of FDG-PET data. Penalized regression yielded more parsimonious models than unpenalized stepwise regression for the integration of multiregional and multimodal imaging information.

Due to these low symptoms, AD disease is difficult to recognize in the early stage. So, the automated computer aided system need to be developed for recognizing the AD disease for minimizing the mortality rate. Initially, brain MRI image is collected from patients which are processed by applying different processing steps such as noise removal, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The captured MRI image has noise that is eliminated by applying the Lucy–Richardson approach which examines the each pixel in the image and removes the Gaussian noise which also eliminates the blur image. After eliminating the noise pixel from the image, affected region is segmented by Prolong adaptive exclusive analytical Atlas approach. From the segmented region, different GLCM statistical features are extracted and optimal features subset is selected by applying the hybrid wrapper filtering approach. This selected features are analyzed by N-fold cross validation approach which recognizes the AD related features successfully. Then the efficiency of the system is evaluated with the help of MATLAB based experimental results, in which Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset images are utilized for examining the efficiency in terms of sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve and accuracy.",0.4981051,0.52930486,0.5349635,0.5252146,0.5034892,0.5504182,0.4844403,0.47306073,0.5265616,0.54954475,0.550168,0.51847935,0.5269294,0.60007167,Earlier detection of Alzheimer disease using N-fold cross validation approach,11/1/2018,,R.

The problem is compounded by the fact that current pharmacologic treatments are only symptomatic, and therapies are ineffective in slow down or cure the degenerative process. An automatic and standardize classifier for Alzheimer's disease is thereby extremely important to rapidly respond and deliver as preventive as possible interventions. Speech alterations might be one of the earliest signs of cognitive defect and, recently, the researchers showed that they can be observable well in advance other cognitive deficits become manifest. In this paper, we propose a full automated method able to classify the spontaneous spoken production of the subjects. In particular, we trained an artificial neural network using the spectrogram of the audio signal, which is the visual representation of the speech of the subject. Moreover, to overcome the problem of the large amount of annotated data usually required for training deep learning models, we used a specific data augmentation approach that avoids distorting the original samples. We evaluated the proposed method using the English Pitt Corpus from DementiaBank. The used dataset consists of 180 subjects: 43 healthy controls and 137 Alzheimer's disease patients. The proposed method outperformed the other approaches in the literature based on manual and semi-automatic transcription and annotation of speech, improving the classification capability by 5.93%, and obtained good classification results compared to the state-of-the-art neuropsychological screening tests (i.e., the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Activities of Daily Living portion of the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale) exhibiting an accuracy of 93.30% and an F1 score of 88.50%.",0.5211733,0.50280523,0.5264459,0.49974063,0.5446546,0.5656706,0.5073473,0.5041288,0.5396347,0.49889073,0.5997554,0.55840576,0.53510475,0.55151343,An automatic Alzheimer's disease classifier based on spontaneous spoken English,3/1/2022,,Flavio Bertini; Davide Allevi; Gianluca Lutero; Laura Calzà; Danilo Montesi,Computer Speech and Language,28,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85115769659&origin=inward,,,,,2022,"@article{,

Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects.

Structural and functional neuroimages, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), are providing powerful imaging modalities to help understand the anatomical and functional neural changes related to AD. In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely studied on analysis of multi-modality neuroimages for quantitative evaluation and computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD. Most existing methods extract the hand-craft imaging features after image preprocessing such as registration and segmentation, and then train a classifier to distinguish AD subjects from other groups. This paper proposes to construct cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the multi-level and multimodal features of MRI and PET brain images for AD classification. First, multiple deep 3D-CNNs are constructed on different local image patches to transform the local brain image into more compact high-level features. Then, an upper high-level 2D-CNN followed by softmax layer is cascaded to ensemble the high-level features learned from the multi-modality and generate the latent multimodal correlation features of the corresponding image patches for classification task. Finally, these learned features are combined by a fully connected layer followed by softmax layer for AD classification. The proposed method can automatically learn the generic multi-level and multimodal features from multiple imaging modalities for classification, which are robust to the scale and rotation variations to some extent. No image segmentation and rigid registration are required in pre-processing the brain images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline MRI and PET images of 397 subjects including 93 AD patients, 204 mild cognitive impairment (MCI, 76 pMCI +128 sMCI) and 100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. Classification methods are needed to combine these multiple biomarkers to provide an accurate diagnosis. State-of-the-art approaches calculate a mixed kernel or a similarity matrix by linearly combining kernels or similarities from multiple modalities. However, the complementary information from multi-modal data are not necessarily linearly related. In addition, this linear combination is also sensitive to the weights assigned to each modality. In this paper, we present a multi-modality classification framework to efficiently exploit the complementarity in the multi-modal data. First, pairwise similarity is calculated for each modality individually using the features including regional MRI volumes, voxel-based FDG-PET signal intensities, CSF biomarker measures, and categorical genetic information. Similarities from multiple modalities are then combined in a nonlinear graph fusion process, which generates a unified graph for final classification. Based on the unified graphs, we achieved classification area under curve (AUC) of receiver-operator characteristic of 98.1% between AD subjects and normal controls (NC), 82.4% between MCI subjects and NC and 77.9% in a three-way classification, which are significantly better than those using single-modality biomarkers and those based on state-of-the-art linear combination approaches.",0.54500794,0.6117455,0.6792428,0.66714865,0.5320896,0.47018912,0.49826565,0.50061876,0.5561992,0.56959397,0.5392922,0.51133597,0.55754644,0.6225755,Multi-modal classification of Alzheimer's disease using nonlinear graph fusion,3/1/2017,,Tong Tong; Katherine Gray; Qinquan Gao; Liang Chen; Daniel Rueckert,Pattern Recognition,178,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84999007060&origin=inward,,,,171-181,2017,"@article{,

The objective of this research was to employ efficient biomarkers for the diagnostic analysis and classification of AD based on combining structural MRI (sMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). So far, several anatomical MRI imaging markers for AD diagnosis have been identified. The use of cortical and subcortical volumes, the hippocampus, and amygdala volume, as well as genetic patterns, has proven to be beneficial in distinguishing patients with AD from the healthy population. The fMRI time series data have the potential for specific numerical information as well as dynamic temporal information. Voxel and graphical analyses have gained popularity for analyzing neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and its prodromal phase, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). So far, these approaches have been utilized separately for the diagnosis of AD. In recent studies, the classification of cases of MCI into those that are not converted for a certain period as stable MCI (MCIs) and those that converted to AD as MCIc has been less commonly reported with inconsistent results. In this study, we verified and validated the potency of a proposed diagnostic framework to identify AD and differentiate MCIs from MCIc by utilizing the efficient biomarkers obtained from sMRI, along with functional brain networks of the frequency range.01–.027 at the resting state and the voxel-based features. The latter mainly included default mode networks (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation [ALFF], fractional ALFF [ALFF], and regional homogeneity [ReHo]), degree centrality (DC), and salience networks (SN). Pearson’s correlation coefficient for measuring fMRI functional networks has proven to be an efficient means for disease diagnosis. We applied the graph theory to calculate nodal features (nodal degree [ND], nodal path length [NL], and between centrality [BC]) as a graphical feature and analyzed the connectivity link between different brain regions. We extracted three-dimensional (3D) patterns to calculate regional coherence and then implement a univariate statistical t-test to access a 3D mask that preserves voxels showing significant changes. Similarly, from sMRI, we calculated the hippocampal subfield and amygdala nuclei volume using Freesurfer (version 6). Finally, we implemented and compared the different feature selection algorithms to integrate the structural features, brain networks, and voxel features to optimize the diagnostic identifications of AD using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. We also compared the performance of SVM with Random Forest (RF) classifiers. The obtained results demonstrated the potency of our framework, wherein a combination of the hippocampal subfield, the amygdala volume, and brain networks with multiple measures of rs-fMRI could significantly enhance the accuracy of other approaches in diagnosing AD. The accuracy obtained by the proposed method was reported for binary classification. More importantly, the classification results of the less commonly reported MCIs vs. MCIc improved significantly.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of AD. Therefore, patients with MCI who are at high risk of fully developing AD should be identified to accurately predict AD. However, the relationship between brain images and AD is difficult to construct because of the complex characteristics of neuroimaging data. To address this problem, we present a longitudinal measurement of MCI brain images and a hierarchical classification method for AD prediction. Longitudinal images obtained from individuals with MCI were investigated to acquire important information on the longitudinal changes, which can be used to classify MCI subjects as either MCI conversion (MCIc) or MCI non-conversion (MCInc) individuals. Moreover, a hierarchical framework was introduced to the classifier to manage high feature dimensionality issues and incorporate spatial information for improving the prediction accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated using 131 patients with MCI (70 MCIc and 61 MCInc) based on MRI scans taken at different time points. Results showed that the proposed method achieved 79.4% accuracy for the classification of MCIc versus MCInc, thereby demonstrating very promising performance for AD prediction.",0.5205345,0.5825604,0.60728914,0.51844484,0.5417598,0.48002964,0.4942559,0.48864308,0.5366492,0.56172067,0.5280925,0.47482833,0.5596755,0.60326505,Longitudinal measurement and hierarchical classification framework for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease,1/12/2017,,Meiyan Huang; Wei Yang; Qianjin Feng; Wufan Chen; Michael W.

In this paper, we propose to predict future clinical changes of MCI patients by using both baseline and longitudinal multimodality data. To do this, we first develop a longitudinal feature selection method to jointly select brain regions across multiple time points for each modality. Specifically, for each time point, we train a sparse linear regression model by using the imaging data and the corresponding clinical scores, with an extra 'group regularization' to group the weights corresponding to the same brain region across multiple time points together and to allow for selection of brain regions based on the strength of multiple time points jointly. Then, to further reflect the longitudinal changes on the selected brain regions, we extract a set of longitudinal features from the original baseline and longitudinal data. Finally, we combine all features on the selected brain regions, from different modalities, for prediction by using our previously proposed multi-kernel SVM. We validate our method on 88 ADNI MCI subjects, with both MRI and FDG-PET data and the corresponding clinical scores (i.e., MMSE and ADAS-Cog) at 5 different time points. We first predict the clinical scores (MMSE and ADAS-Cog) at 24-month by using the multimodality data at previous time points, and then predict the conversion of MCI to AD by using the multimodality data at time points which are at least 6-month ahead of the conversion. The results on both sets of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance in predicting future clinical changes of MCI patients than the conventional methods. © 2012 Zhang et al.",0.45881775,0.5568793,0.58562607,0.5816399,0.49331874,0.46772227,0.46247223,0.4547344,0.5036939,0.49665272,0.4884496,0.45925763,0.5000055,0.5180545,Predicting future clinical changes of MCI patients using longitudinal and multimodal biomarkers,3/22/2012,,Daoqiang Zhang; Dinggang Shen,PLoS ONE,227,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863351725&origin=inward,,,,,2012,"@article{,

The goal of this study was to utilize predictors for diagnosis conversion to AD based on integrating resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity analysis and structural MRI (sMRI). We included 177 subjects in this study and aimed at identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progress to AD, MCI converter (MCI-C), patients with MCI who do not progress to AD, MCI non-converter (MCI-NC), patients with AD, and healthy controls (HC). The graph theory was used to characterize different aspects of the rs-fMRI brain network by calculating measures of integration and segregation. The cortical and subcortical measurements, e.g., cortical thickness, were extracted from sMRI data. The rs-fMRI graph measures were combined with the sMRI measures to construct input features of a support vector machine (SVM) and classify different groups of subjects. Two feature selection algorithms [i.e., the discriminant correlation analysis (DCA) and sequential feature collection (SFC)] were used for feature reduction and selecting a subset of optimal features. Maximum accuracy of 67 and 56% for three-group (“AD, MCI-C, and MCI-NC” or “MCI-C, MCI-NC, and HC”) and four-group (“AD, MCI-C, MCI-NC, and HC”) classification, respectively, were obtained with the SFC feature selection algorithm. We also identified hub nodes in the rs-fMRI brain network which were associated with the early stage of AD.

Most previous work in this area has centred around the same automated techniques used to diagnose AD patients from healthy controls, by coupling high dimensional brain image data or other relevant biomarker data to modern machine learning techniques. Such studies can now distinguish between AD patients and controls as accurately as an experienced clinician. Models trained on patients with AD and control subjects can also distinguish between MCI patients that will convert to AD within a given timeframe (MCI-c) and those that remain stable (MCI-s), although differences between these groups are smaller and thus, the corresponding accuracy is lower. The most common type of classifier used in these studies is the support vector machine, which gives categorical class decisions. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian process (GP) classification to the problem. This fully Bayesian method produces naturally probabilistic predictions, which we show correlate well with the actual chances of converting to AD within 3 years in a population of 96 MCI-s and 47 MCI-c subjects. Furthermore, we show that GPs can integrate multimodal data (in this study volumetric MRI, FDG-PET, cerebrospinal fluid, and APOE genotype with the classification process through the use of a mixed kernel). The GP approach aids combination of different data sources by learning parameters automatically from training data via type-II maximum likelihood, which we compare to a more conventional method based on cross validation and an SVM classifier. When the resulting probabilities from the GP are dichotomised to produce a binary classification, the results for predicting MCI conversion based on the combination of all three types of data show a balanced accuracy of 74%. This is a substantially higher accuracy than could be obtained using any individual modality or using a multikernel SVM, and is competitive with the highest accuracy yet achieved for predicting conversion within three years on the widely used ADNI dataset. © 2013 The Authors.

The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for radiology applications consider only pixel-value information without data informing clinical context. Yet in practice, pertinent and accurate non-imaging data based on the clinical history and laboratory data enable physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to a higher diagnostic accuracy, informative clinical decision making, and improved patient outcomes. To achieve a similar goal using deep learning, medical imaging pixel-based models must also achieve the capability to process contextual data from electronic health records (EHR) in addition to pixel data. In this paper, we describe different data fusion techniques that can be applied to combine medical imaging with EHR, and systematically review medical data fusion literature published between 2012 and 2020. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus for original research articles leveraging deep learning for fusion of multimodality data. In total, we screened 985 studies and extracted data from 17 papers.

AD symptoms develop over a period of years and, unfortunately, there is no cure. Existing AD treatments can only slow down the progression of symptoms and thus it is critical to diagnose the disease at an early stage. To help improve the early diagnosis of AD, a deep learning-based classification model with an embedded feature selection approach was used to classify AD patients. An AD DNA methylation data set (64 records with 34 cases and 34 controls) from the GEO omnibus database was used for the analysis. Before selecting the relevant features, the data were preprocessed by performing quality control, normalization and downstream analysis. As the number of associated CpG sites was huge, four embedded-based feature selection models were compared and the best method was used for the proposed classification model. An Enhanced Deep Recurrent Neural Network (EDRNN) was implemented and compared to other existing classification models, including a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN).

Along with the development of deep learning, impressive progress has also been made in the automatic diagnosis of AD. Most existing studies on automatic diagnosis are concerned with a single base network, whose accuracy for disease diagnosis still needs to be improved. This study was undertaken to propose a method to improve the accuracy of the automatic diagnosis of AD. Materials and Methods: MRI image data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were used to train a deep learning model to achieve a computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The data consisted of 138 with AD, 280 with mild cognitive impairment, and 138 normal controls. Here, a new deeply-fused net is proposed, which combines several deep convolutional neural networks, thereby avoiding the error of a single base network and increasing the classification accuracy and generalization capacity. Results: Experiments show that when differentiating between patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and normal controls on a subset of the ADNI database without data leakage, the new architecture improves the accuracy by about 4 percentage points as compared to a single standard based network. Conclusion: This new approach exhibits better performance, but there is still much to be done before its clinical application. In the future, greater research effort will be devoted to improving the performance of the deeply-fused net.",0.5565144,0.5928727,0.60705847,0.5962073,0.55609345,0.5520105,0.51293784,0.5003658,0.5484506,0.5811903,0.6156096,0.54792917,0.62439543,0.59924453,Diagnosis of alzheimer's disease based on deeply-fused nets,1/1/2021,,Chang Zu Chen; Qi Wu; Zuo Yong Li; Lei Xiao; Zhong Yi Hu,Combinatorial Chemistry and High Throughput Screening,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85108303851&origin=inward,,,,781-789,2021,"@article{,

Recently, computer scientists have developed various methods for early detection based on computer vision and machine learning techniques. Method. In this study, we proposed a novel AD detection method by displacement field (DF) estimation between a normal brain and an AD brain. The DF was treated as the AD-related features, reduced by principal component analysis (PCA), and finally fed into three classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), generalized eigenvalue proximal SVM (GEPSVM), and twin SVM (TSVM). The 10-fold cross validation repeated 50 times. Results. The results showed the ""DF + PCA + TSVM"" achieved the accuracy of 92.75 ± 1.77, sensitivity of 90.56 ± 1.15, specificity of 93.37 ± 2.05, and precision of 79.61 ± 2.21. This result is better than or comparable with not only the other proposed two methods, but also ten state-of-the-art methods.

We proposed an Alzheimer's Disease VGG-Inspired Attention Network (ADVIAN), where we integrate convolutional block attention modules on a VIN backbone.

By 2025, the number of elderly patients with AD aged 65 and over will reach 7.1 million, an increase of nearly 29% over the 5.5 million patients of the same age in 2018. Unless medical breakthroughs are made, AD patients may increase from 5.5 million to 13.8 million by 2050, almost three times the original. Researchers have focused on developing complex machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNNs), containing millions of parameters. However, CNN models need many training samples. A small number of training samples in CNN models may lead to overfitting problems. With the continuous research of CNN, other networks have been proposed, such as randomized neural networks (RNNs). Schmidt neural network (SNN), random vector functional link (RVFL), and extreme learning machine (ELM) are three types of RNNs. Methods: We propose three novel models to classify brain diseases to cope with these problems. The proposed models are DenseNet-based SNN (DSNN), DenseNet-based RVFL (DRVFL), and DenseNet-based ELM (DELM). The backbone of the three proposed models is the pre-trained “customize” DenseNet. The modified DenseNet is fine-tuned on the empirical dataset. Finally, the last five layers of the fine-tuned DenseNet are substituted by SNN, ELM, and RVFL, respectively. Results: Overall, the DSNN gets the best performance among the three proposed models in classification performance. We evaluate the proposed DSNN by five-fold cross-validation. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score of the proposed DSNN on the test set are 98.46% ± 2.05%, 100.00% ± 0.00%, 85.00% ± 20.00%, 98.36% ± 2.17%, and 99.16% ± 1.11%, respectively.

In addition, it is unclear how the algorithms would perform on previously unseen data, and thus, how they would perform in clinical practice when there is no real opportunity to adapt the algorithm to the data at hand. To address these comparability, generalizability and clinical applicability issues, we organized a grand challenge that aimed to objectively compare algorithms based on a clinically representative multi-center data set. Using clinical practice as the starting point, the goal was to reproduce the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, we evaluated algorithms for multi-class classification of three diagnostic groups: patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The diagnosis based on clinical criteria was used as reference standard, as it was the best available reference despite its known limitations. For evaluation, a previously unseen test set was used consisting of 354 T1-weighted MRI scans with the diagnoses blinded. Fifteen research teams participated with a total of 29 algorithms. The algorithms were trained on a small training set (n. =. 30) and optionally on data from other sources (e.g., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of aging). The best performing algorithm yielded an accuracy of 63.0% and an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 78.8%. In general, the best performances were achieved using feature extraction based on voxel-based morphometry or a combination of features that included volume, cortical thickness, shape and intensity.

In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms (""SPM2-type"" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

The motivation of this work is spatial normalization of MR images from patients with brain tumors in a common stereotaxic space, aiming to pool data from different patients into a common space in order to perform group analyses. Additionally, transfer of structural and functional information from neuroanatomical brain atlases into the individual patient's space can be achieved via the inverse mapping, for the purpose of segmenting brains and facilitating surgical or radiotherapy treatment planning. A method that estimates the brain tissue loss and replacement by tumor is applied for achieving equivalent image content between an atlas and a patient's scan, based on a biomechanical model of tumor growth. Automated estimation of the parameters modeling brain tissue loss and displacement is performed via optimization of an objective function reflecting feature-based similarity and elastic stretching energy, which is optimized in parallel via APPSPACK (Asynchronous Parallel Pattern Search). The results of the method, applied to 21 brain tumor patients, indicate that the registration accuracy is relatively high in areas around the tumor, as well as in the healthy portion of the brain. Also, the calculated deformation in the vicinity of the tumor is shown to correlate highly with expert-defined visual scores indicating the tumor mass effect, thereby potentially leading to an objective approach to quantification of mass effect, which is commonly used in diagnosis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we propose a novel model for AD with Brain Image Analysis (BIA). Initially, the image database is considered for the removal of the unwanted region. Then an intermediate output is sent to extract the considerable features such as, texture, histogram, and scale-invariant transform from the magnetic resonance images of the brain.

However, available medicines can delay its progress. Therefore, the early detection of AD plays a crucial role in preventing and controlling its progression. The main objective is to design an end-to-end framework for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and medical image classification for various AD stages. A deep learning approach, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), is used in this work. Four stages of the AD spectrum are multi-classified. Furthermore, separate binary medical image classifications are implemented between each two-pair class of AD stages. Two methods are used to classify the medical images and detect AD. The first method uses simple CNN architectures that deal with 2D and 3D structural brain scans from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset based on 2D and 3D convolution. The second method applies the transfer learning principle to take advantage of the pre-trained models for medical image classifications, such as the VGG19 model. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for people to go to hospitals periodically to avoid gatherings and infections. As a result, Alzheimer’s checking web application is proposed using the final qualified proposed architectures. It helps doctors and patients to check AD remotely.

Nine performance metrics are used in the evaluation and the comparison between the two methods.

354,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37769-z,0.000173336,27,1,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by a decline in cognitive functions with no validated disease modifying treatment. It is critical for timely treatment to detect AD in its earlier stage before clinical manifestation. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between cognitively normal older adults and AD. To predict conversion from MCI to probable AD, we applied a deep learning approach, multimodal recurrent neural network. We developed an integrative framework that combines not only cross-sectional neuroimaging biomarkers at baseline but also longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive performance biomarkers obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI). The proposed framework integrated longitudinal multi-domain data. Our results showed that 1) our prediction model for MCI conversion to AD yielded up to 75% accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.83) when using only single modality of data separately; and 2) our prediction model achieved the best performance with 81% accuracy (AUC = 0.86) when incorporating longitudinal multi-domain data. A multi-modal deep learning approach has potential to identify persons at risk of developing AD who might benefit most from a clinical trial or as a stratification approach within clinical trials.",0.5471518,0.5876386,0.63976556,0.6408325,0.5690533,0.5785991,0.52141315,0.51288974,0.542337,0.5576598,0.59992564,0.5587126,0.5890528,0.5758132,Predicting Alzheimer’s disease progression using multi-modal deep learning approach,12/1/2019,,Garam Lee; Kwangsik Nho; Byungkon Kang; Kyung Ah Sohn; Dokyoon Kim; Michael W.

2074,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40708-015-0028-9,3.92E-05,5,56,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, causing changes in memory, thinking, and other dysfunction of brain functions. More and more people are suffering from the disease. Early neuroimaging techniques of AD are needed to develop. This review provides a preliminary summary of the various neuroimaging techniques that have been explored for in vivo imaging of AD. Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) techniques, such as functional MR imaging (fMRI) and diffusion MRI, give opportunities to display not only anatomy and atrophy of the medial temporal lobe, but also at microstructural alterations or perfusion disturbance within the AD lesions. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become the subject of intense research for the diagnosis and facilitation of drug development of AD in both animal models and human trials due to its non-invasive and translational characteristic. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and amyloid PET are applied in clinics and research departments. Amyloid beta (Aβ) imaging using PET has been recognized as one of the most important methods for the early diagnosis of AD, and numerous candidate compounds have been tested for Aβ imaging. Besides in vivo imaging method, a lot of ex vivo modalities are being used in the AD researches. Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy, neuroimaging of metals, and several metal bioimaging methods are also mentioned here. More and more multimodality and multiparametric neuroimaging techniques should improve our understanding of brain function and open new insights into the pathophysiology of AD. We expect exciting results will emerge from new neuroimaging applications that will provide scientific and medical benefits.",0.45482147,0.49076697,0.4765331,0.5655981,0.43513298,0.4560399,0.39526588,0.37716126,0.44564688,0.4574258,0.47884026,0.4779356,0.43829608,0.46179652,Quantitative multimodal multiparametric imaging in Alzheimer’s disease,3/1/2016,,Qian Zhao; Xueqi Chen; Yun Zhou,Brain Informatics,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85026346603&origin=inward,,,,29-37,2016,"@article{,

Since 2017, deep learning models with transfer learning approaches have been gaining recognition in AD detection, and progression prediction by using neuroimaging biomarkers. This paper presents a systematic review of the current state of early AD detection by using deep learning models with transfer learning and neuroimaging biomarkers. Five databases were used and the results before screening report 215 studies published between 2010 and 2020. After screening, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. We noted that the maximum accuracy achieved to date for AD classification is 98.20% by using the combination of 3D convolutional networks and local transfer learn-ing, and that for the prognostic prediction of AD is 87.78% by using pre-trained 3D convolutional network-based architectures. The results show that transfer learning helps researchers in developing a more accurate system for the early diagnosis of AD.

Although, research on AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25 AD) from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100%, 96.85%, 97.38%, 97.43%, 97.40% and 98.01% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92% and 97.88% for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively.

Currently, there is no effective cure for AD, but its progression can be delayed with some treatments. Accurate and early diagnosis of AD is vital for the patient care and development of future treatment. Fluorodeoxyglucose positrons emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a functional molecular imaging modality, which proves to be powerful to help understand the anatomical and neural changes of brain related to AD. Most existing methods extract the handcrafted features from images, and then design a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups.

Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a new classification framework based on combination of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which learns the intra-slice and inter-slice features for classification after decomposition of the 3D PET image into a sequence of 2D slices. The 2D CNNs are built to capture the features of image slices while the gated recurrent unit (GRU) of RNN is cascaded to learn and integrate the inter-slice features for image classification. No rigid registration and segmentation are required for PET images.

Early prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD is still a challenging task. No study has been able to predict the exact conversion time of MCI patients. In addition, most studies have achieved poor performance making this prediction using only a small number of features (e.g., using only MRI images). Therefore, previous approaches have not gained the trust of medical experts. This study proposes a novel two-stage deep learning AD progression detection framework based on information fusion of several patient longitudinal multivariate modalities, including neuroimaging data, cognitive scores, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, neuropsychological battery markers, and demographics. The first stage of the progression detection framework employs a multiclass classification task that predicts a patient’s diagnosis (i.e., cognitively normal, MCI, or AD). In the second stage, a regression task that predicts the exact conversion time of MCI patients is used. The study is based on data of 1,371 subjects collected by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Comprehensive experiments were carried out to evaluate the framework stages and find the optimal model for each stage. Proposed model was compared with various machine learning models, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). In the classification stage, the proposed long-short term memory (LSTM) model achieved an accuracy of 93.87%, precision of 94.070%, recall of 94.07%, and F1-score of 94.07%. The results showed that the LSTM model outperformed other machine learning models (i.e., decision tree by 2.48%, random forest by 1.27%, support vector machine by 1.86%, logistic regression by 1.59%, and K-nearest neighbor by 14.77%). In the regression stage, the proposed LSTM model achieved the best results (i.e., mean absolute error of 0.1375). Compared to other regular regressors, this LSTM model achieved less errors (i.e., 0.0064, 0.0152, 0.0338, 0.0118, 0.0198, and 0.0066, compared to DT, RF, SVM, LR, and KNN, respectively). By learning deep representation from patient high-dimensional longitudinal time-series data, the proposed LSTM model was more stable and medically acceptable.

Nevertheless, research studies often have little effect on clinical practice mainly due to the following reasons: (1) Most studies depend mainly on a single modality, especially neuroimaging; (2) diagnosis and progression detection are usually studied separately as two independent problems; and (3) current studies concentrate mainly on optimizing the performance of complex machine learning models, while disregarding their explainability. As a result, physicians struggle to interpret these models, and feel it is hard to trust them. In this paper, we carefully develop an accurate and interpretable AD diagnosis and progression detection model. This model provides physicians with accurate decisions along with a set of explanations for every decision. Specifically, the model integrates 11 modalities of 1048 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) real-world dataset: 294 cognitively normal, 254 stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 232 progressive MCI, and 268 AD. It is actually a two-layer model with random forest (RF) as classifier algorithm. In the first layer, the model carries out a multi-class classification for the early diagnosis of AD patients. In the second layer, the model applies binary classification to detect possible MCI-to-AD progression within three years from a baseline diagnosis. The performance of the model is optimized with key markers selected from a large set of biological and clinical measures. Regarding explainability, we provide, for each layer, global and instance-based explanations of the RF classifier by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature attribution framework. In addition, we implement 22 explainers based on decision trees and fuzzy rule-based systems to provide complementary justifications for every RF decision in each layer. Furthermore, these explanations are represented in natural language form to help physicians understand the predictions. The designed model achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 93.95% and an F1-score of 93.94% in the first layer, while it achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 87.08% and an F1-Score of 87.09% in the second layer. The resulting system is not only accurate, but also trustworthy, accountable, and medically applicable, thanks to the provided explanations which are broadly consistent with each other and with the AD medical literature. The proposed system can help to enhance the clinical understanding of AD diagnosis and progression processes by providing detailed insights into the effect of different modalities on the disease risk.",0.51649284,0.56402487,0.6085542,0.57545096,0.529182,0.5893556,0.5012781,0.47614574,0.5319658,0.54734087,0.5739495,0.52656746,0.5698703,0.5451761,A multilayer multimodal detection and prediction model based on explainable artificial intelligence for Alzheimer’s disease,12/1/2021,,Shaker El-Sappagh; Jose M.

These neuropathological features precede cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s dementia by many years. To better understand and predict the course of disease from early-stage asymptomatic to late-stage dementia, it is critical to study the patterns of progression of multiple markers. In particular, we aim to predict the likely future course of progression for individuals given only a single observation of their markers. Improved individual-level prediction may lead to improved clinical care and clinical trials. We propose a two-stage approach to modeling and predicting measures of cognition, function, brain imaging, fluid biomarkers, and diagnosis of individuals using multiple domains simultaneously. In the first stage, joint (or multivariate) mixed-effects models are used to simultaneously model multiple markers over time. In the second stage, random forests are used to predict categorical diagnoses (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia) from predictions of continuous markers based on the first-stage model. The combination of the two models allows one to leverage their key strengths in order to obtain improved accuracy. We characterize the predictive accuracy of this two-stage approach using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The two-stage approach using a single joint mixed-effects model for all continuous outcomes yields better diagnostic classification accuracy compared to using separate univariate mixed-effects models for each of the continuous outcomes. Overall prediction accuracy above 80% was achieved over a period of 2.5 years. The results further indicate that overall accuracy is improved when markers from multiple assessment domains, such as cognition, function, and brain imaging, are used in the prediction algorithm as compared to the use of markers from a single domain only.",0.5412986,0.587988,0.6444296,0.583329,0.528818,0.53680575,0.4905595,0.47733602,0.56592256,0.52519995,0.5670402,0.5064644,0.53452355,0.5458144,Predicting the course of Alzheimer’s progression,12/1/2019,,Samuel Iddi; Dan Li; Paul S.

Neuroimaging reveals extensive information about the brain’s anatomy and enables the identification of diagnostic features. Artificial intelligence (AI) in neuroimaging has the potential to significantly enhance the treatment process for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The objective of this study is two-fold: (1) to compare existing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of AD. (2) To propose an effective ensemble-based model for the same and to perform its comparative analysis. In this study, data from the Alzheimer’s Diseases Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), an online repository, is utilized for experimentation consisting of 2125 neuroimages of Alzheimer’s disease (n = 975), mild cognitive impairment (n = 538) and cognitive normal (n = 612). For classification, the framework incorporates a Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) followed by some variations of Support Vector Machine (SVM), such as SVM (RBF kernel), SVM (Polynomial Kernel), and SVM (Sigmoid kernel), as well as Gradient Boost (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN). Afterwards, an Ensemble Based Generic Kernel is presented where Master-Slave architecture is combined to attain better performance. The proposed model is an ensemble of Extreme Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree and SVM_Polynomial kernel (XGB + DT + SVM). At last, the proposed method is evaluated using cross-validation using statistical techniques along with other ML models. The presented ensemble model (XGB + DT + SVM) outperformed existing state-of-the-art algorithms with an accuracy of 89.77%. The efficiency of all the models was optimized using Grid-based tuning, and the results obtained after such process showed significant improvement. XGB + DT + SVM with optimized parameters outperformed all other models with an efficiency of 95.75%. The implication of the proposed ensemble-based learning approach clearly shows the best results compared to other ML models.

In total, data from 764 participants were compared across five in vivo imaging methods. Convergence of effects was seen in posterior cortical regions, including posterior cingulate, retrosplenial, and lateral parietal cortex. These regions were active in default states in young adults and also showed amyloid deposition in older adults with AD. At early stages of AD progression, prominent atrophy and metabolic abnormalities emerged in these posterior cortical regions; atrophy in medial temporal regions was also observed. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging studies further revealed that these cortical regions are active during successful memory retrieval in young adults. One possibility is that lifetime cerebral metabolism associated with regionally specific default activity predisposes cortical regions to AD-related changes, including amyloid deposition, metabolic disruption, and atrophy. These cortical regions may be part of a network with the medial temporal lobe whose disruption contributes to memory impairment.

Proposed imaging-based markers have shown steadily improving levels of sensitivity/specificity in classifying individual subjects as AD or normal. Several of these efforts have utilized statistical machine learning techniques, using brain images as input, as means of deriving such AD-related markers. A common characteristic of this line of research is a focus on either (1) using a single imaging modality for classification, or (2) incorporating several modalities, but reporting separate results for each. One strategy to improve on the success of these methods is to leverage all available imaging modalities together in a single automated learning framework. The rationale is that some subjects may show signs of pathology in one modality but not in another-by combining all available images a clearer view of the progression of disease pathology will emerge. Our method is based on the Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL) framework, which allows the inclusion of an arbitrary number of views of the data in a maximum margin, kernel learning framework. The principal innovation behind MKL is that it learns an optimal combination of kernel (similarity) matrices while simultaneously training a classifier. In classification experiments MKL outperformed an SVM trained on all available features by 3%-4%. We are especially interested in whether such markers are capable of identifying early signs of the disease. To address this question, we have examined whether our multi-modal disease marker (MMDM) can predict conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. Our experiments reveal that this measure shows significant group differences between MCI subjects who progressed to AD, and those who remained stable for 3. years. These differences were most significant in MMDMs based on imaging data. We also discuss the relationship between our MMDM and an individual's conversion from MCI to AD. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",0.54442304,0.59684217,0.63254875,0.61384386,0.5583291,0.51769394,0.514232,0.49983206,0.5726763,0.57089037,0.55870426,0.53192914,0.53114,0.5996576,Predictive markers for AD in a multi-modality framework: An analysis of MCI progression in the ADNI population,3/15/2011,,Chris Hinrichs; Vikas Singh; Guofan Xu; Sterling C.

And the number of patients currently suffering continues to rise each year. With the rapid development of medical imaging technology, although researchers have done extensive works on the diagnosis of AD through new computer vision technology, it is still a challenge to realize the diagnosis of AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) as precise as possible end-to-end by relying on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image resources. In this paper, a new variant model of the Broad Learning System (BLS) for accurate diagnosis of AD and MCI is presented for MRI images. The proposed model is composed of two modules named feature mapping module and feature enhancement module. To adapt to the characteristics of medical images, a new feature mapping module that contains multi groups of feature down-sampling is designed to get the multi-scale features of the images without any additional feature selection. As a result, the proposed model can integrate multi-scale convolution features of the feature mapping module and abstract features of the feature enhancement module end-to-end when learning the AD diagnostic task. At the same time, the proposed model is a lightweight model whose complexity has been significantly simplified. To verify the validity of the proposed model, the ANDI-1 dataset was used in the relevant experiments. After 5-fold cross-validation, the proposed model has achieved the accuracy of 91.83% and 75.52% for the AD diagnostic task and MCI diagnostic task, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model could achieve better performance compared to other methods under the AD and MCI diagnostic tasks.",0.52926695,0.5881451,0.57030314,0.5838856,0.57591283,0.57883656,0.5190591,0.5054015,0.540538,0.582766,0.5807497,0.5381137,0.5771002,0.60539144,Multi-scale 3D convolution feature-based Broad Learning System for Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis via MRI images,5/1/2022,,Ruizhi Han; Zhulin Liu; C.

Advances in technologies produced high-dimensional data of different modalities including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Understanding the complex association patterns among these heterogeneous and complementary data is of benefit to the diagnosis and prevention of AD. In this paper, we apply the appropriate correlation analysis method to detect the relationships between brain regions and genes, and propose 'brain region-gene pairs' as the multimodal features of the sample. In addition, we put forward a novel data analysis method from technology aspect, cluster evolutionary random forest (CERF), which is suitable for 'brain region-gene pairs'. The idea of clustering evolution is introduced to improve the generalization performance of random forest which is constructed by randomly selecting samples and sample features. Through hierarchical clustering of decision trees in random forest, the decision trees with higher similarity are clustered into one class, and the decision trees with the best performance are retained to enhance the diversity between decision trees. Furthermore, based on CERF, we integrate feature construction, feature selection and sample classification to find the optimal combination of different methods, and design a comprehensive diagnostic framework for AD. The framework is validated by the samples with both fMRI and SNP data from ADNI. The results show that we can effectively identify AD patients and discover some brain regions and genes associated with AD significantly based on this framework.

Risk prediction models for AD based on various computational approaches, including machine learning, are being developed with promising results. However, these approaches have been criticised as they are unable to generalise due to over-reliance on one data source, poor internal and external validations, and lack of understanding of prediction models, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these prediction models. We propose a framework that employs a transfer-learning paradigm with ensemble learning algorithms to develop explainable personalised risk prediction models for dementia. Our prediction models, known as source models, are initially trained and tested using a publicly available dataset (n = 84,856, mean age = 69 years) with 14 years of follow-up samples to predict the individual risk of developing dementia. The decision boundaries of the best source model are further updated by using an alternative dataset from a different and much younger population (n = 473, mean age = 52 years) to obtain an additional prediction model known as the target model. We further apply the SHapely Additive exPlanation (SHAP) algorithm to visualise the risk factors responsible for the prediction at both population and individual levels. The best source model achieves a geometric accuracy of 87%, specificity of 99%, and sensitivity of 76%. In comparison to a baseline model, our target model achieves better performance across several performance metrics, within an increase in geometric accuracy of 16.9%, specificity of 2.7%, and sensitivity of 19.1%, an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 11% and a transfer learning efficacy rate of 20.6%. The strength of our approach is the large sample size used in training the source model, transferring and applying the “knowledge” to another dataset from a different and undiagnosed population for the early detection and prediction of dementia risk, and the ability to visualise the interaction of the risk factors that drive the prediction.

Thus, predicting AD progression is crucial for clinical practice and medical research. Due to limited neuroimaging data, two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D CNNs) have been commonly adopted to differentiate among cognitively normal subjects (CN), people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients. Therefore, this paper proposes an ensemble learning (EL) architecture based on 2D CNNs, using a multi-model and multi-slice ensemble. First, the top 11 coronal slices of grey matter density maps for AD versus CN classifications were selected. Second, the discriminator of a generative adversarial network, VGG16, and ResNet50 were trained with the selected slices, and the majority voting scheme was used to merge the multi-slice decisions of each model. Afterwards, those three classifiers were used to construct an ensemble model. Multi-slice ensemble learning was designed to obtain spatial features, while multi-model integration reduced the prediction error rate. Finally, transfer learning was used in domain adaptation to refine those CNNs, moving them from working solely with AD versus CN classifications to being applicable to other tasks. This ensemble approach achieved accuracy values of 90.36%, 77.19%, and 72.36% when classifying AD versus CN, AD versus MCI, and MCI versus CN, respectively.

Currently, deep learning networks are used for the diagnosis of AD, but it suffers from the limitations of gradient descent training of deep networks like local minima, slow learning speed, and overfitting. Also, there is a need to select hyperparameters like learning rate, momentum, number of epochs, and regularization coefficient.

First, the MRI images’ features are extracted using transfer learning, and the classification of the extracted features is done using a non-iterative random vector initialized RVFL network.

The leading cause of AD is dementia that results in a person's inability to work independently. In the early stages of AD, a person forgets recent conversations or the occurrence of an event. In the later stages, there could be severe loss of memory such that the person is not able to even perform everyday tasks. The medicines currently available for AD may improve its symptoms on a temporary basis in the early stage of the disease. Since no treatment is available for curing AD, its detection becomes extremely important. As the clinical treatments are very expensive, the need for automated diagnosis of AD is of critical importance. In this paper, a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network has been used and applied to four classes of images of AD that is very mild demented, mild demented, average demented, and non-demented. It was found that the moderate demented class had the highest accuracy of 98.9%, a classification error rate of 0.01, and a specificity of 0.992.

Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) is widely used as an important imaging modality for AD diagnosis. Most of existing methods for MRI classification are based on image data of single time point. However, the longitudinal analysis of sequential MR images is also important to model and measure the progression of the disease along the time axis. In this paper, we present a classification framework based on combination of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for longitudinal analysis of MR images for AD diagnosis. First, MLP is constructed to learn the spatial features of MR images with the task of AD classification. After that, RNN with cascaded two bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRU) layers is trained on the MLP outputs for extracting the longitudinal features from the imaging data of multiple time points, providing a final classification predicting score. The proposed method can automatically learn the spatial and longitudinal features from the imaging data of multiple time points with variable length for classification.

There is converging belief that disease-modifying treatments should focus on early stages of the disease, that is, the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical stages. Making a diagnosis of AD and offering a prognosis (likelihood of converting to AD) at these early stages are challenging tasks but possible with the help of multimodality imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission topography (PET), amyloid-PET, and recently introduced tau-PET, which provides different but complementary information. This article is a focused review of existing research in the recent decade that used statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to perform quantitative analysis of multimodality image data for diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the MCI or preclinical stages. We review the existing work in 3 subareas: diagnosis, prognosis, and methods for handling modality-wise missing data—a commonly encountered problem when using multimodality imaging for prediction or classification.

Our method for performing the classification of AD is to combine a set of shearlet-based descriptors with deep features. A major challenge in classifying such MRI datasets is the high dimensionality of feature vectors because of the large number of slices of each MRI sample. Given the volumetric nature of the MRI data, we propose using the 3D shearlet transform (3D-ST), but we obtain the average of all directionalities, which reduces the dimensionality. On the other hand, we propose to leverage the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn feature maps from stacked MRI slices, which generate a very compact feature vector for each MRI sample. The 3D-ST and CNN feature vectors are combined for the classification of AD. After the concatenation of the feature vectors, they are used to train a classifier. Alternatively, a custom CNN model is utilized, in which the descriptors are further processed end to end to obtain the classification model.

Most existing methods extract the handcraft features from images, and then train a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups.

Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task.

Structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is capable of detecting the disease-induced anatomical changes in the brain, thus aiding the diagnosis of AD. MR image attributes extracted from the hippocampal regions are commonly used for the AD classification task. However, most of the published methods do not explore hippocampal asymmetries for image classification. In this study, we propose a new technique for performing the classification of MR images for AD using only hippocampal asymmetrical attributes. By using the new proposed asymmetry index (AI), we assessed the attributes and the ones that passed the analysis of variance test, i.e., showing statistically mean differences among the classes (CN, MCI, and AD), were selected for classification. As a result of our study, the statistical analysis of our AI has shown a significant increase in hippocampal asymmetry as disease progress (CN < MCI < AD).

The parameters such as tolerance factor, window lengths and scales for computation of multiscale entropy for significant differentiation amongst the healthy and diseased subjects are experimentally evaluated. The obtained entropy values from healthy subjects are observed to be significantly lower from the pathological subjects across scales. Classification with extracted features using a linear discriminant classifier achieves an accuracy of 80.1% and 87.6% for Normal vs MCI and Normal vs AD classes, respectively. The proposed multiscale entropy-based approach captures the textural alterations in lateral ventricles of brain MR images and furthermore, can be used as automated tool for early diagnosis of AD.",0.49459758,0.5453401,0.5262964,0.51092833,0.49006185,0.47376814,0.4589522,0.44795337,0.50252295,0.53399503,0.5192043,0.5088326,0.50608844,0.57657224,Differentiation of Alzheimer conditions in brain MR images using bidimensional multiscale entropy-based texture analysis of lateral ventricles,9/1/2022,,Amrutha Veluppal; Deboleena sadhukhan; Venugopal gopinath; Ramakrishanan swaminathan,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134800711&origin=inward,,,,,2022,"@article{,

The number of patients with AD will grow rapidly each year and AD is the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. In recent years, one of the main challenges for medical investigators has been the early diagnosis of patients with AD because an early diagnosis can provide greater opportunities for patients to be eligible for more clinical trials and they will have enough time to plan for future, medical and financial decisions. An established risk factor for AD is mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which is described as a transitional state between normal aging and AD patients. Hence an accurate and reliable diagnosis of MCI can be very effective and helpful for early diagnosis of AD. Therefore in this paper we present a novel and efficient method based on pseudo Zernike moments (PZMs) for the diagnosis of MCI individuals from AD and healthy control (HC) groups using structural MRI. The proposed method uses PZMs to extract discriminative information from the MR images of the AD, MCI, and HC groups. Two types of artificial neural networks, which are based on pattern recognition and learning vector quantization (LVQ) networks, were used to classify the information extracted from the MRIs. We worked with 500 MRIs from the database of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1 1.5T). The 1 slice of 500 MRIs used in this study included 180 AD patients, 172 MCI patients, and 148 HC individuals. We selected 50 percent of the MRIs randomly for use in training the classifiers, 25 percent for validation and we used 25 percent for the testing phase. The technique proposed here yielded the best overall classification results between AD and MCI (accuracy 94.88%, sensitivity 94.18%, and specificity 95.55%), and for pairs of the MCI and HC (accuracy 95.59%, sensitivity 95.89% and specificity 95.34%).

As like most of the DNN models, LeNet also uses MaxPooling layer for dimensionality reduction by eliminating the information of minimum valued elements. In brain images low intensity valued pixels also may contain very important features. To keep the minimum valued elements too in the network, we have created a separate layer that performs Min-Pooling operation. MinPooling and MaxPooling layers are then concatenated together. Finally, we have replaced all MaxPooling Layers in LeNet by the concatenated layers. We have analysed and compared the performances of modified LeNet model with 20 other most commonly used DNN models, and some of the related works.

To study this problem, in this paper we present a novel Joint Multi-Modal Longitudinal Regression and Classification method and show how it can be used to identify the cognitive status of the participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and the underlying biological mechanisms. By intelligently combining clinical data of various modalities (i.e., genetic information and brain scans) using a variety of regularizations that can identify AD-relevant biomarkers, we perform the regression and classification tasks simultaneously. Because the proposed objective is a non-smooth optimization problem that is difficult to solve in general, we derive an efficient iterative algorithm and rigorously prove its convergence. To validate our new method in predicting the cognitive scores of patients and their clinical diagnosis, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the ADNI cohort. Our promising results demonstrate the benefits and flexibility of the proposed method. We anticipate that our new method is of interest to clinical communities beyond AD research and have open-sourced the code of our method online.11The code package for the proposed Joint Multi-Modal Longitudinal Regression and Classification model have been made publicly available online at https://github.com/minds-mines/jmmlrc.",0.50727427,0.5639173,0.624259,0.60831225,0.5334767,0.5713909,0.5125043,0.50871146,0.5230791,0.5392847,0.55545604,0.5103001,0.54676485,0.5515315,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

Early detection of AD and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which can be either stable (sMCI) or progressive (pMCI), is highly desirable for effective treatment planning and tailoring therapy. Recent studies recommended using multimodal data fusion of genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and neuroimaging data (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)) to discriminate AD/MCI from normal control (NC) subjects. However, missing multimodal data in the cohort under study is inevitable. In addition, data heterogeneity between phenotypes and genotypes biomarkers makes learning capability of the models more challenging. Also, the current studies mainly focus on identifying brain disease classification and ignoring the regression task. Furthermore, they utilize multistage for predicting the brain disease progression. To address these issues, we propose a novel multimodal neuroimaging and genetic data fusion for joint classification and clinical score regression tasks using the maximum number of available samples in one unified framework using convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, we initially perform a technique based on linear interpolation to fill the missing features for each incomplete sample. Then, we learn the neuroimaging features from MRI, PET, and SNPs using CNN to alleviate the heterogeneity among genotype and phenotype data. Meanwhile, the high learned features from each modality are combined for jointly identifying brain diseases and predicting clinical scores. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we test our method on 805 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Also, we verify the similarity between the synthetic and real data using statistical analysis. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can yield better performance in both classification and regression tasks. Specifically, our proposed method achieves accuracy of 98.22%, 93.11%, and 97.35% for NC vs. AD, NC vs. sMCI, and NC vs. pMCI, respectively.

The identification of patients at high risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD via earlier close monitoring, targeted investigations, and appropriate management is crucial. Recently, several machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used for AD progression detection. Most of these studies only utilized neuroimaging data from baseline visits. However, AD is a complex chronic disease, and usually, a medical expert will analyze the patient's whole history when making a progression diagnosis. Furthermore, neuroimaging data are always either limited or not available, especially in developing countries, due to their cost. In this paper, we compare the performance of five widely used ML algorithms, namely, the support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and decision tree to predict AD progression with a prediction horizon of 2.5 years. We use 1029 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. In contrast to previous literature, our models are optimized using a collection of cost-effective time-series features including patient's comorbidities, cognitive scores, medication history, and demographics.

Predicting the progression of Alzheimer's disease with longitudinal analysis on the time series data has recently received increasing attention. However, training an accurate progression model for brain network faces two major challenges: missing features, and the small sample size during the follow-up study. According to our analysis on the AD progression task, we thoroughly analyze the correlation among the multiple predictive tasks of AD progression at multiple time points. Thus, we propose a multi-task learning framework that can adaptively impute missing values and predict future progression over time from a subject's historical measurements. Progression is measured in terms of MRI volumetric measurements, trajectories of a cognitive score and clinical status. To this end, we propose a new perspective of predicting the AD progression with a multi-task learning paradigm. In our multi-task learning paradigm, we hypothesize that the inherent correlations exist among: (i). the prediction tasks of clinical diagnosis, cognition and ventricular volume at each time point; (ii). the tasks of imputation and prediction; and (iii). the prediction tasks at multiple future time points. According to our findings of the task correlation, we develop an end-to-end deep multi-task learning method to jointly improve the performance of assigning missing value and prediction. We design a balanced multi-task dynamic weight optimization. With in-depth analysis and empirical evidence on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we show the benefits and flexibility of the proposed multi-task learning model, especially for the prediction at the M60 time point.

AD biomarkers do not evolve in an identical manner but rather in a sequential but temporally overlapping manner. Models of the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers can take the form of plots of biomarker severity (degree of abnormality) versus time.

The close AD monitoring of this disease is essential for the patient treatment plan adjustment. For AD monitoring, clinical score prediction via neuroimaging data is highly desirable since it is able to reveal the disease status, adequately. For this task, most previous studies are focused on a single time point without considering relationship between neuroimaging data (e.g., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)) and clinical scores at multiple time points. Differing from these studies, we propose to build a framework based on longitudinal multiple time points data to predict clinical scores. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three parts, feature selection based on correntropy regularized joint learning, feature encoding based on deep polynomial network, and ensemble learning for regression via the support vector regression method. Two scenarios are designed for scores prediction. Namely, scenario 1 uses the baseline data to achieve the longitudinal scores prediction, while scenario 2 utilizes all the previous time points data to obtain the predicted scores at the next time point, which can improve the score prediction's accuracy. Meanwhile, the missing clinical scores at longitudinal multiple time points are imputated to solve the incompleteness of the data.

Magnetic resonance images (MRI) have been widely used as an important imaging modality of brain for AD diagnosis and monitoring the disease progression. The longitudinal analysis of sequential MRIs is important to model and measure the progression of the disease along the time axis for more accurate diagnosis. Most existing methods extracted the features capturing the morphological abnormalities of brain and their longitudinal changes using MRIs and then designed a classifier to discriminate different groups. However, these methods have several limitations. First, since the feature extraction and classifier model are independent, the extracted features may not capture the full characteristics of brain abnormalities related to AD. Second, longitudinal MR images may be missing at some time points for some subjects, which results in difficulties for extraction of consistent features for longitudinal analysis. In this paper, we present a classification framework based on combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks for longitudinal analysis of structural MR images in AD diagnosis. First, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is constructed to learn the spatial features of MR images for the classification task. After that, recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with cascaded three bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRU) layers is constructed on the outputs of CNN at multiple time points for extracting the longitudinal features for AD classification. Instead of independently performing feature extraction and classifier training, the proposed method jointly learns the spatial and longitudinal features and disease classifier, which can achieve optimal performance. In addition, the proposed method can model the longitudinal analysis using RNN from the imaging data at various time points.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal state of AD, which is further classified into a progressive state (i.e., pMCI) and a stable state (i.e., sMCI). With the development of deep learning, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made great progress in image recognition using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) for AD diagnosis. However, due to the limited availability of these imaging data, it is still challenging to effectively use CNNs for AD diagnosis. Toward this end, we design a novel deep learning framework. Specifically, the virtues of 3D-CNN and fully stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (FSBi-LSTM) are exploited in our framework. First, we design a 3D-CNN architecture to derive deep feature representation from both MRI and PET. Then, we apply FSBi-LSTM on the hidden spatial information from deep feature maps to further improve its performance. Finally, we validate our method on the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our method achieves average accuracies of 94.82%, 86.36%, and 65.35% for differentiating AD from normal control (NC), pMCI from NC, and sMCI from NC, respectively, and outperforms the related algorithms in the literature.",0.5404807,0.5475418,0.5718023,0.6116878,0.5582862,0.5507343,0.5026785,0.5017129,0.5382137,0.57351404,0.59188294,0.54353905,0.61236787,0.5886923,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

In this paper, we review the recent application of AI based CAD systems on AD and its stages, with a particular focus on the use of structural MRI due to its cost effectiveness and lack of ionizing radiation. We will review important factors of different AI techniques pertinent to AD, summarize contributions from different research groups, critically discuss challenges involved and propose directions for future research.

It is not clear whether abnormalities of cortical anatomy in AD can be reliably measured across different subject samples, how closely they track symptoms, and whether they are detectable prior to symptoms. An exploratory map of cortical thinning in mild AD was used to define regions of interest that were applied in a hypothesis-driven fashion to other subject samples. Results demonstrate a reliably quantifiable in vivo signature of abnormal cortical anatomy in AD, which parallels known regional vulnerability to AD neuropathology. Thinning in vulnerable cortical regions relates to symptom severity even in the earliest stages of clinical symptoms. Furthermore, subtle thinning is present in asymptomatic older controls with brain amyloid binding as detected with amyloid imaging. The reliability and clinical validity of AD-related cortical thinning suggests potential utility as an imaging biomarker.

However, not all individuals with MCI develop dementia. Predicting whether individuals with MCI will decline (i.e. progressive MCI) or remain stable (i.e. stable MCI) is impeded by patient heterogeneity due to comorbidities that may lead to MCI diagnosis without progression to AD. Despite the importance of early diagnosis of AD for prognosis and personalised interventions, we still lack robust tools for predicting individual progression to dementia. Here, we propose a novel trajectory modelling approach based on metric learning (Generalised Metric Learning Vector Quantization) that mines multimodal data from MCI patients in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort to derive individualised prognostic scores of cognitive decline due to AD. We develop an integrated biomarker generation– using partial least squares regression– and classification methodology that extends beyond binary patient classification into discrete subgroups (i.e. stable vs. progressive MCI), determines individual profiles from baseline (i.e. cognitive or biological) data and predicts individual cognitive trajectories (i.e. change in memory scores from baseline). We demonstrate that a metric learning model trained on baseline cognitive data (memory, executive function, affective measurements) discriminates stable vs. progressive MCI individuals with high accuracy (81.4%), revealing an interaction between cognitive (memory, executive functions) and affective scores that may relate to MCI comorbidity (e.g. affective disturbance). Training the model to perform the same binary classification on biological data (mean cortical β-amyloid burden, grey matter density, APOE 4) results in similar prediction accuracy (81.9%). Extending beyond binary classifications, we develop and implement a trajectory modelling approach that shows significantly better performance in predicting individualised rate of future cognitive decline (i.e. change in memory scores from baseline), when the metric learning model is trained with biological (r = −0.68) compared to cognitive (r = −0.4) data. Our trajectory modelling approach reveals interpretable and interoperable markers of progression to AD and has strong potential to guide effective stratification of individuals based on prognostic disease trajectories, reducing MCI patient misclassification, that is critical for clinical practice and discovery of personalised interventions.",0.50114816,0.55567163,0.5995598,0.5643464,0.5246137,0.5186045,0.50629044,0.48259145,0.5525504,0.49005547,0.53499466,0.48672152,0.49911967,0.5193053,Modelling prognostic trajectories of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease,1/1/2020,,Joseph Giorgio; Susan M.

In addition to the adverse ill-health effects on the patients, AD imposes paramount responsibility and burden on the caretakers too. Several genetic and pathological traits and non-invasive diagnostic strategies are being vigorously investigated and explored to discover the early onset of this debilitating disease. The prognosis of AD assumes importance, as the deterioration of health due to its progression may be either contained or controlled. Moreover, early and accurate detection of AD helps medical practitioners to prescribe case-specific medical treatment procedure. Among the popular machine learning algorithms, decision tree technique is widely used for classification/prediction, due to its accuracy and speed.This research article presents a novel decision tree-based classification technique, with optimum hyper parametertuning, that is ideally suitable for AD diagnosis, even at the early stages of development. The performance of this newly proposed Decision Tree Classifier with Hyper Parameters Tuning (DTC-HPT) is validated on the Open Access Imaging Studies Series (OASIS) dataset that contains patients' data on the different stages of AD. The DTC-HPT is designed with the primary objective to classify the nature of brain abnormality using the most relevantand potentially significant data attributes/parameters. The efficiency of DTC-HPT on AD classification is measured as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Researchers are making efforts to find ways in early detection of AD to help in slowing down its progression.

However, not all individuals clinically diagnosed with MCI progress to AD. A fraction of subjects with MCI either progress to non-AD dementia or remain stable at the MCI stage without progressing to dementia. Although a curative treatment of AD is currently unavailable, it is extremely important to correctly identify the individuals in the MCI phase that will go on to develop AD so that they may benefit from a curative treatment when one becomes available in the near future. At the same time, it would be highly desirable to also correctly identify those in the MCI phase that do not have AD pathology so they may be spared from unnecessary pharmocologic interventions that, at best, may provide them no benefit, and at worse, could further harm them with adverse side-effects. Additionally, it may be easier and simpler to identify the cause of the cognitive impairment in these non-AD cases, and hence proper identification of prodromal AD will be of benefit to these individuals as well. Fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) captures the metabolic activity of the brain, and this imaging modality has been reported to identify changes related to AD prior to the onset of structural changes. Prior work on designing classifier using FDG-PET imaging has been promising. Since deep-learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool to mine features and use them for accurate labeling of the group membership of given images, we propose a novel deep-learning framework using FDG-PET metabolism imaging to identify subjects at the MCI stage with presymptomatic AD and discriminate them from other subjects with MCI (non-AD / non-progressive).

Alzheimer's disease seriously affects the normal lives of the elderly and their families. The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between the normal aging and Alzheimer's disease, and MCI is most likely to converted to AD later. MCI is often misdiagnosed as the symptoms of normal aging, which results to miss the best opportunity of treatment. Therefore, the accurate diagnosis of MCI is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD. This paper presents a deep learning model for the auxiliary diagnosis of AD, which simulates the clinician's diagnostic process. During the diagnosis of AD, clinician usually refers to the results of various neuroimaging, as well as the results of neuropsychological diagnosis. In this paper, the multi-modal medical images are trained by two independent convolutional neural networks. Then the consistency of the output of two convolutional neural networks is judged by the correlation analysis. Finally, the results of multi-modal neuroimaging diagnosis are combined with the results of clinical neuropsychological diagnosis. The proposed model provides a comprehensive analysis about patient's pathology and psychology at the same time, therefore, it improves the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis. The diagnosis process is closer to the process of clinician's diagnosis and easy to implement. Experiments on the public database of ADNI (Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative) show that the proposed method has better performance, and can achieve an excellent diagnostic efficiency in the auxiliary diagnosis of AD.",0.56089437,0.5664355,0.61933225,0.63315856,0.5635323,0.6018216,0.5158432,0.50792634,0.5381463,0.58555603,0.59479713,0.55793995,0.6073226,0.59652454,Multi-modal deep learning model for auxiliary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,10/7/2019,,Fan Zhang; Zhenzhen Li; B.

Currently there is no cure for AD and early diagnosis is crucial to the development of treatments that can delay the disease progression. Brain imaging can be a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. This has been shown in several works with MR Images, but in the case of functional imaging such as PET, further investigation is still needed to determine their ability to diagnose AD, especially at the early stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). In this paper we study the use of PET images of the ADNI database for the diagnosis of AD and MCI. We adopt a Boosting classification method, a technique based on a mixture of simple classifiers, which performs feature selection concurrently with the segmentation thus is well suited to high dimensional problems.

The successful implementation of machine learning (ML) techniques has also shown their effectiveness and its reliability as one of the better options for an early diagnosis of AD. But the heterogeneous dimensions and composition of the disease data have undoubtedly made diagnostics more difficult, needing a sufficient model choice to overcome the difficulty. Therefore, in this paper, four different 2D and 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks based on Bayesian search optimization are proposed to develop an optimized deep learning model to predict the early onset of AD binary and ternary classification on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Moreover, certain hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizers, and hidden units are to be set and adjusted for the performance boosting of the deep learning model. Bayesian optimization enables to leverage advantage throughout the experiments: A persistent hyperparameter space testing provides not only the output but also about the nearest conclusions. In this way, the series of experiments needed to explore space can be substantially reduced.

In clinical practice, it is a challenging task to identify AD in its early stages, and there are currently very few reliable diagnostic systems available for the identification. Additionally, clinical studies for AD medications have a high risk of failure, and currently, there is no confirmed cure. There are various stages of AD: very mild demented, mild, and moderate. It is challenging to identify these stages, due to which the very mild demented case worsens and results in a complete health loss along with weak memory and makes it unable to perform daily tasks without the assistance of others. Early identification of mild cases can help patients to guide additional medical care to stop the disease's progression and avoid brain damage. Recently, there has been a substantial amount of interest in applying deep learning (DL) for early AD recognition. The limitations of these algorithms are that they cannot detect changes in the brain networks in patients with mild demented functional working brain networks. However, to stop AD growth, various scientists and researchers are striving to build methods for early identification by using MRI images. In this article, for early diagnoses of AD, two MRI datasets containing 6400 and 6330 images have been used, and the DL algorithm is utilized by applying a neural network classifier with a VGG16 feature extractor for the early diagnosis of AD, which results in the outcome in the form of accuracy, precision, recall, AUC and F1-score as (90.4%, 0.905, 0.904, 0.969, and 0.904), and (71.1%, 0.71, 0.711, 0.85, and 0.71) for dataset 1 and dataset 2, respectively.

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to create a framework that can be used to detect specific Alzheimer's disease characteristics from MRI images. By considering four stages of dementia and conducting a particular diagnosis, the proposed model generates high-resolution disease probability maps from the local brain structure to a multilayer perceptron and provides accurate, intuitive visualizations of individual Alzheimer's disease risk. To avoid the problem of class imbalance, the samples should be evenly distributed among the classes. The obtained MRI image dataset from Kaggle has a major class imbalance problem. A DEMentia NETwork (DEMNET) is proposed to detect the dementia stages from MRI. The DEMNET achieves an accuracy of 95.23%, Area Under Curve (AUC) of 97% and Cohen's Kappa value of 0.93 from the Kaggle dataset, which is superior to existing methods.

With the growth of the older population in developed nations, the prevalence of AD is expected to triple over the next 50 years while its early diagnosis remains being a difficult task. Functional imaging modalities including Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are often used with the aim of achieving early diagnosis. However, conventional evaluation of SPECT images often relies on manual reorientation, visual reading of tomographic slices and semiquantitative analysis of certain regions of interest (ROIs). These steps are time consuming, subjective and prone to error. This paper shows a fully automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for improving the early detection of the AD. The proposed approach is based on image parameter selection and support vector machine (SVM) classification. A study is carried out in order to finding the ROIs and the most discriminant image parameters with the aim of reducing the dimensionality of the input space and improving the accuracy of the system. Among all the features evaluated, coronal standard deviation and sagittal correlation parameters are found to be the most effective ones for reducing the dimensionality of the input space and improving the diagnosis accuracy when a radial basis function (RBF) SVM is used.

Radiomic features obtained from brain MRI have shown a great potential as non-invasive biomarkers for this disease; however, their usefulness has not yet been explored for individual brain regions. In this paper, we hypothesize that distinct regions are affected differently by AD and, thus, that shape or texture changes occurring in separate regions can be expressed by different radiomic features. Moreover, to improve the classification of AD and healthy control (HC) subjects, we propose novel features based on the entropy of the convolution neural network (CNN) feature maps. The proposed approach is evaluated comprehensively using the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. Our experiments assess the significance of 45 different radiomic features from individual subcortical regions, via the Wilcoxon test. We also use the random forest classifier to identify the subcortical regions that best differentiate AD patients from HC subjects. Our analysis identified the features derived from several subcortical regions that show significant differences between AD and HC (corrected p < 0.01 ). Specifically, we found correlation and volume features from the hippocampus (AUC = 81.19% - 84.09%) and amygdala (AUC = 79.70% - 80.27%) regions to have the greatest discriminative power. Furthermore, the proposed entropy features derived from CNN layers yielded the highest classification AUC of 92.58%, compared to 84.45% for the combined radiomic features of all subcortical.

Its development has been shown to be closely related to changes in the brain connectivity network and in the brain activation patterns along with structural changes caused by the neurodegenerative process. Methods to infer dependence between brain regions are usually derived from the analysis of covariance between activation levels in the different areas. However, these covariance-based methods are not able to estimate conditional independence between variables to factor out the influence of other regions. Conversely, models based on the inverse covariance, or precision matrix, such as Sparse Gaussian Graphical Models allow revealing conditional independence between regions by estimating the covariance between two variables given the rest as constant. This paper uses Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation (SICE) methods to learn undirected graphs in order to derive functional and structural connectivity patterns from Fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) Position Emission Tomography (PET) data and segmented Magnetic Resonance images (MRI), drawn from the ADNI database, for Control, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment Subjects), and AD subjects. Sparse computation fits perfectly here as brain regions usually only interact with a few other areas. The models clearly show different metabolic covariation patters between subject groups, revealing the loss of strong connections in AD and MCI subjects when compared to Controls. Similarly, the variance between GM (Gray Matter) densities of different regions reveals different structural covariation patterns between the different groups. Thus, the different connectivity patterns for controls and AD are used in this paper to select regions of interest in PET and GM images with discriminative power for early AD diagnosis. Finally, functional an structural models are combined to leverage the classification accuracy. The results obtained in this work show the usefulness of the Sparse Gaussian Graphical models to reveal functional and structural connectivity patterns. This information provided by the sparse inverse covariance matrices is not only used in an exploratory way but we also propose a method to use it in a discriminative way. Regression coefficients are used to compute reconstruction errors for the different classes that are then introduced in a SVM for classification.

Early detection of AD can help with proper treatment and prevent brain tissue damage. Traditional medical tests are time consuming, fail to recognize early signs and lack of diagnosis sensitivity and specificity. To achieve promising prediction accuracy, the best predictive machine learning model is selected based on initial pre-processing step followed by vital attributes selection and performance evaluation for five proposed supervised machine learning algorithms. In the pre-processing, all the missing values have been removed since the overall percentage only covered 5.63%. Boruta algorithm as feature selection method resulted Atlas Scaling Factor, Estimated Total Intracranial Volume, Normalized Whole-brain Volume, Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating must be included as primary features.

Although dementia cannot be cured, it is very important to detect preclinical AD as early as possible. Several studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the joint use of structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and cognitive measures to detect and track the progression of the disease. Since hippocampal atrophy is a well known biomarker for AD progression state, we propose here a novel methodology, exploiting it as a searchlight to detect the best discriminating features for the classification of subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) converting (MCI-c) or not converting (MCI-nc) to AD. In particular, we define a significant subdivision of the hippocampal volume in fuzzy classes, and we train for each class Support Vector Machine SVM classifiers on cognitive and morphometric measurements of normal controls (NC) and AD patients. From the ADNI database, we used MRI scans and cognitive measurements at baseline of 372 subjects, including 98 subjects with AD, and 117 NC as a training set, 86 with MCI-c and 71 with MCI-nc as an independent test set. The accuracy of early diagnosis was evaluated by means of a longitudinal analysis. The proposed methodology was able to accurately predict the disease onset also after one year (median AUC = 88.2%, interquartile range 87.2%–89.0%). Besides its robustness, the proposed fuzzy methodology naturally incorporates the uncertainty degree intrinsically affecting neuroimaging features.

Although fewer people, who suffer from AD are correctly and promptly diagnosed, due to a lack of knowledge of its cause and unavailability of treatment, AD is more manageable if the symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are in an early stage. In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis has been widely used for the diagnosis of AD. The main motive of this paper is to improve the classification and prediction accuracy of AD. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to classify MCI, normal control (NC), and AD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (50 AD, 50 NC, 50 MCI subjects). FreeSurfer is used to process these MRI data and obtain cortical features such as volume, surface area, thickness, white matter (WM), and intrinsic curvature of the brain regions. These features are modified by normalizing each cortical region's features using the absolute maximum value of that region's features from all subjects in each group of MCI, NC, and AD independently. A total of 420 features are obtained. To address the curse of dimensionality, the obtained features are reduced to 30 features using a sequential feature selection technique. Three classifiers, namely the twin support vector machine (TSVM), least squares TSVM (LSTSVM), and robust energy-based least squares TSVM (RELS-TSVM), are used to evaluate the classification accuracy from the obtained features. Five-fold and 10-fold cross-validation are used to validate the proposed method. Experimental results show an accuracy of 100% for the studied database.

The framework has three novel aspects: (1) An l2,1-norm regularization term combined with the multiclass hinge loss is used to naturally select features across all the classes in each modality. (2) To fuse the complementary information contained in each modality, an lp-norm (1<p<∞) regularization term is introduced to combine different kernels to perform multiple kernel learning to avoid a sparse kernel coefficient distribution, thereby effectively exploiting complementary modalities. (3) A theorem that transforms the multiclass hinge loss minimization problem using the l2,1-norm and lp-norm regularizations to a previous solvable optimization problem and its proof are given.

It is extremely important to correctly identify patients during the MCI stage because this is the phase where AD may or may not develop. Thus, it is crucial to predict outcomes during this phase. Thus far, many researchers have worked on only using a single modality of a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. Although recent studies show that a combination of one or more different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis, it also increases the classification accuracy distinguishing between different groups. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based framework to discriminate subjects with AD or MCI utilizing a combination of four different biomarkers: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels, and Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline dataset was used in this study. In total, there were 158 subjects for whom all four modalities of biomarker were available. Of the 158 subjects, 38 subjects were in the AD group, 82 subjects were in MCI groups (including 46 in MCIc [MCI converted; conversion to AD within 24 months of time period], and 36 in MCIs [MCI stable; no conversion to AD within 24 months of time period]), and the remaining 38 subjects were in the healthy control (HC) group. For each image, we extracted 246 regions of interest (as features) using the Brainnetome template image and NiftyReg toolbox, and later we combined these features with three CSF and two APOE genotype features obtained from the ADNI website for each subject using early fusion technique. Here, a different kernel-based multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a grid-search method was applied. Before passing the obtained features to the classifier, we have used truncated singular value decomposition (Truncated SVD) dimensionality reduction technique to reduce high dimensional features into a lower-dimensional feature.

Nevertheless, only part of MCI subjects could progress to AD. The main objective of this paper is thus to identify those who will develop a dementia of AD type among MCI patients. 18F-FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FDG PET) serves as a neuroimaging modality for early diagnosis as it can reflect neural activity via measuring glucose uptake at resting-state. In this paper, we design a deep network on 18F-FDG PET modality to address the problem of AD identification at early MCI stage. To this end, a Multi-view Separable Pyramid Network (MiSePyNet) is proposed, in which representations are learned from axial, coronal and sagittal views of PET scans so as to offer complementary information and then combined to make a decision jointly. Different from the widely and naturally used 3D convolution operations for 3D images, the proposed architecture is deployed with separable convolution from slice-wise to spatial-wise successively, which can retain the spatial information and reduce training parameters compared to 2D and 3D networks, respectively.

Identifying biomarkers that can track the progress of the disease has recently received increasing attentions in AD research. An accurate prediction of disease progression would facilitate optimal decision-making for clinicians and patients. A definitive diagnosis of AD requires autopsy confirmation, thus many clinical/cognitive measures including Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) have been designed to evaluate the cognitive status of the patients and used as important criteria for clinical diagnosis of probable AD. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting disease progression measured by the cognitive scores and selecting biomarkers predictive of the progression. Specifically, we formulate the prediction problem as a multi-task regression problem by considering the prediction at each time point as a task and propose two novel multi-task learning formulations. We have performed extensive experiments using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Specifically, we use the baseline MRI features to predict MMSE/ADAS-Cog scores in the next 4. years. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-task learning formulations for disease progression in comparison with single-task learning algorithms including ridge regression and Lasso. We also perform longitudinal stability selection to identify and analyze the temporal patterns of biomarkers in disease progression. We observe that cortical thickness average of left middle temporal, cortical thickness average of left and right Entorhinal, and white matter volume of left Hippocampus play significant roles in predicting ADAS-Cog at all time points. We also observe that several MRI biomarkers provide significant information for predicting MMSE scores for the first 2. years, however very few are shown to be significant in predicting MMSE score at later stages. The lack of predictable MRI biomarkers in later stages may contribute to the lower prediction performance of MMSE than that of ADAS-Cog in our study and other related studies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",0.4705369,0.52827775,0.5662646,0.53676444,0.49435976,0.5040988,0.47101846,0.45227328,0.51504326,0.50043625,0.5198567,0.49486637,0.5015486,0.48920208,Modeling disease progression via multi-task learning,9/1/2013,,Jiayu Zhou; Jun Liu; Vaibhav A.

Though, diagnosis of AD at early onset may delay the progression of the disease and thus aid in improving the subject's well-being. Early detection and classification of divergent phases of AD using EHR (Electronic Health Record) and ML (Machine Learning) algorithms can prove to be a productive approach as AD evolves with time and thus patients at distinct stages need to be treated differently.

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease can help with proper treatment and prevent brain tissue damage. Several statistical and machine learning models have been exploited by researchers for Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. Detection of Alzheimer's Disease is exacting due to the similarity in Alzheimer's Disease Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data and standard healthy MRI data of older people. Recently, advanced deep learning techniques have successfully demonstrated human-level performance in numerous fields including medical image analysis.

It has become one of the critical diseases throughout the world. Moreover, there is no remedy for Alzheimer's disease. Machine learning techniques, especially deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are used to improve the process for the detection of Alzheimer's disease. In recent days, CNN has achieved major success in MRI image analysis and biomedical research. A lot of research has been carried out for the detection of Alzheimer's disease based on brain MRI images using CNN. However, one of the fundamental limitations is that proper comparison between a proposed CNN model and pre-trained CNN models (InceptionV3, Xception, MobilenetV2, VGG) was not established. Therefore, in this paper, we present a model based on 12-layer CNN for binary classification and detection of Alzheimer's disease using brain MRI data. The performance of the proposed model is compared with some existing CNN models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. The main contribution of the paper is a 12-layer CNN model with an accuracy of 97.75%, which is higher than any other existing CNN models published on this dataset.

The disease can be divided into five stages: Subjective Memory Concern (SMC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Alzheimer's disease is conventionally diagnosed using an MRI scan of the brain. In this research, we propose a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier called AlzheimerNet, which can identify all five stages of Alzheimer's disease and the Normal Control (NC) class. The ADNI database's MRI scan dataset is obtained for use in training and testing the proposed model. To prepare the raw data for analysis, we applied the CLAHE image enhancement method. Data augmentation was used to remedy the unbalanced nature of the dataset and the resultant dataset consisted of 60000 image data on the 6 classes. Initially, five existing models including VGG16, MobileNetV2, AlexNet, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 were trained and tested to achieve test accuracies of 78.84%, 86.85%, 78.87%, 80.98% and 96.31% respectively. Since InceptionV3 provides the highest accuracy, this model is later modified to design the AlzheimerNet using RMSprop optimizer and learning rate 0.00001 to achieve the highest test accuracy of 98.67%. The five pre-trained models and the proposed fine-tuned model were compared in terms of various performance matrices to demonstrate whether the AlzheimerNet model is in fact performing better in classifying and detecting the six classes. An ablation study shows the hyperparameters used in the experiment.

It exhibits behavioral symptoms such as communication impairments, memory loss, taking a longer time to complete usual activities, and change in attitude and behavior. If the problem worsens over time, then it cannot be cured. Hence it should be identified at the earlier stage itself and treat the patient to lead a normal life on their own.

Research into Alzheimer's disease therapy has been at least partly successful in terms of developing symptomatic treatments, but has also had several failures in terms of developing disease-modifying therapies. These successes and failures have led to debate about the potential deficiencies in our understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and potential pitfalls in diagnosis, choice of therapeutic targets, development of drug candidates, and design of clinical trials. Many clinical and experimental studies are ongoing, but we need to acknowledge that a single cure for Alzheimer's disease is unlikely to be found and that the approach to drug development for this disorder needs to be reconsidered. Preclinical research is constantly providing us with new information on pieces of the complex Alzheimer's disease puzzle, and an analysis of this information might reveal patterns of pharmacological interactions instead of single potential drug targets.

However, as our knowledge increases so does our appreciation for the pathogenic complexity of the disorder. Familial Alzheimer's disease is a very rare autosomal dominant disease with early onset, caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin genes, both linked to Aβ metabolism. By contrast with familial disease, sporadic Alzheimer's disease is very common with more than 15 million people affected worldwide. The cause of the sporadic form of the disease is unknown, probably because the disease is heterogeneous, caused by ageing in concert with a complex interaction of both genetic and environmental risk factors.

The disease is expected to increase further in the upcoming years with the increase of the elderly population. Developing new treatments and diagnostic methods is getting more important. In this study, we focused on the early diagnosis of dementia in Alzheimer's disease via analysis of neuroimages. We analyzed the data diagnosed by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol. The analyzed data were T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of 159 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 217 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 109 cognitively healthy older people. In this study, we propose that the volumetric reduction in the hippocampus is the most important indicator of Alzheimer's disease. There is not much research about the relationship between the volumetric reduction in the hippocampus and Alzheimer's disease. This volume information was calculated through semi-automatic segmentation software ITK-SNAP and a data set was created based on age, gender, diagnosis, and right and left hippocampal volume values. The diagnosis via hippocampal volume information was made by using machine learning techniques. By using this approach, we conclude that brain MRIs can be used to distinguish the patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Cognitive Normal (CN) from each other; while most of the studies were only able to distinguish AD from CN.

Its prodromal stage amnestic mild cognitive impairment is characterized by deficits of anterograde episodic memory. The development of standardized imaging inclusion criteria has to be regarded as a prerequisite for future diagnostic systems. Moreover, successful treatment requires isolating imaging markers predicting the disease. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic and quantitative meta-analysis to reveal the prototypical neural correlates of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage. To prevent any a priori assumptions and enable a data-driven approach only studies applying quantitative automated whole brain analysis were included. Finally, 40 studies were identified involving 1351 patients and 1097 healthy control subjects reporting either atrophy or decreases in glucose utilization and perfusion. The currently most sophisticated and best-validated of coordinate-based voxel-wise meta-analyses was applied (anatomical likelihood estimates). The meta-analysis reveals that early Alzheimer's disease affects structurally the (trans-)entorhinal and hippocampal regions, functionally the inferior parietal lobules and precuneus. Results further may suggest that atrophy in the (trans-)entorhinal area/hippocampus and hypometabolism/hypoperfusion in the inferior parietal lobules predicts most reliably the progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, whereas changes in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus are unspecific. Fully developed Alzheimer's disease involved additionally a frontomedian-thalamic network. In conclusion, the meta-analysis characterizes the prototypical neural substrates of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage amnestic mild cognitive impairment.

Multi-modal imaging such as structural MRI and DTI provide useful information for the classification of patients on the basis of brain biomarkers. Recently, CNN methods have emerged as powerful tools to improve classification using images. New Method: In this paper, we propose a transfer learning scheme using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify brain scans focusing only on a small ROI: e.g. a few slices of the hippocampal region. The network's architecture is similar to a LeNet-like CNN upon which models are built and fused for AD stage classification diagnosis. We evaluated various types of transfer learning through the following mechanisms: (i) cross-modal (sMRI and DTI) and (ii) cross-domain transfer learning (using MNIST) (iii) a hybrid transfer learning of both types. Results: Our method shows good performances even on small datasets and with a limited number of slices of small brain region. It increases accuracy with more than 5 points for the most difficult classification tasks, i.e., AD/MCI and MCI/NC. Comparison with Existing Method(s): Our methodology provides good accuracy scores for classification over a shallow convolutional network. Besides, we focused only on a small region; i.e., the hippocampal region, where few slices are selected to feed the network. Also, we used cross-modal transfer learning. Conclusions: Our proposed method is suitable for working with a shallow CNN network for low-resolution MRI and DTI scans. It yields to significant results even if the model is trained on small datasets, which is often the case in medical image analysis.",0.5495477,0.5527307,0.5769791,0.60206527,0.6566842,0.53380036,0.6067073,0.60141873,0.53947085,0.58138,0.60785997,0.5611555,0.6042795,0.59492815,Improving Alzheimer's stage categorization with Convolutional Neural Network using transfer learning and different magnetic resonance imaging modalities,12/1/2020,,Karim Aderghal; Karim Afdel; Jenny Benois-Pineau; Gwénaëlle Catheline,Heliyon,49,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85097470965&origin=inward,,,,,2020,"@article{,

In this study, we employed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for MCI subtype classification. This was carried out in a sample of 184 community-dwelling individuals (aged 73-85 years). Cortical surface based measurements were computed from longitudinal and cross-sectional scans. By introducing a feature selection algorithm, we identified a set of discriminative features, and further investigated the temporal patterns of these features.

The best classification accuracies achieved were: 77% (naMCI vs. aMCI), 81% (aMCI vs. cognitively normal (CN)) and 70% (naMCI vs. CN). The best results for differentiating aMCI from naMCI were achieved with baseline features. Hippocampus, amygdala and frontal pole were found to be most discriminative for classifying MCI subtypes.

Accurate diagnosis of aMCI would enable earlier treatment, and could thus help minimize the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a magnetic resonance imaging-based automated classification schema for identifying aMCI. This was carried out in a sample of community-dwelling adults aged 70-90. years old: 79 with a clinical diagnosis of aMCI and 204 who were cognitively normal. Our schema was novel in using measures of both spatial atrophy, derived from T1-weighted images, and white matter alterations, assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Subcortical volumetric features were extracted using a FreeSurfer-initialized Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (FS. +. LDDMM) segmentation approach, and fractional anisotropy (FA) values obtained for white matter regions of interest. Features were ranked by their ability to discriminate between aMCI and normal cognition, and a support vector machine (SVM) selected an optimal feature subset that was used to train SVM classifiers. As evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation, the classification performance characteristics achieved by our schema were: accuracy, 71.09%; sensitivity, 51.96%; specificity, 78.40%; and area under the curve, 0.7003. Additionally, we identified numerous socio-demographic, lifestyle, health and other factors potentially implicated in the misclassification of individuals by our schema and those previously used by others. Given its high level of performance, our classification schema could facilitate the early detection of aMCI in community-dwelling elderly adults. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0.49948975,0.49470893,0.53043514,0.5079439,0.49666357,0.471024,0.47646996,0.46276045,0.5428493,0.48116186,0.5020084,0.4580213,0.49297473,0.56815845,Automated detection of amnestic mild cognitive impairment in community-dwelling elderly adults: A combined spatial atrophy and white matter alteration approach,1/16/2012,,Yue Cui; Wei Wen; Darren M.

Moreover, categorizing NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and AD early in course allows the patients to experience benefits from new treatments. Therefore, it is important to construct a reliable classification technique to discriminate the patients with or without AD from the bio medical imaging modality. Hence, we developed a novel FCM based Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network (FWPNN) classification algorithm and analyzed the brain images related to structural MRI modality for better discrimination of class labels. Initially our proposed framework begins with brain image normalization stage. In this stage, ROI regions related to Hippo-Campus (HC) and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from the brain images are extracted using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. Subsequently, nineteen highly relevant AD related features are selected through Multiple-criterion feature selection method. At last, our novel FWPNN classification algorithm is imposed to remove suspicious samples from the training data with an end goal to enhance the classification performance. This newly developed classification algorithm combines both the goodness of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The experimental validation is carried out with the ADNI subset and then to the Bordex-3 city dataset. Our proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of about 98.63%, 95.4%, 96.4% in terms of classification with AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI.

We aimed at assessing the accuracy of brain FDG-PET in discriminating patients with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls. Sixty-two patients with amnestic MCI and 109 healthy subjects recruited in five centers of the European AD Consortium were enrolled. Group analysis was performed by SPM8 to confirm metabolic differences. Discriminant analyses were then carried out using the mean FDG uptake values normalized to the cerebellum computed in 45 anatomical volumes of interest (VOIs) in each hemisphere (90 VOIs) as defined in the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) Atlas and on 12 meta-VOIs, bilaterally, obtained merging VOIs with similar anatomo-functional characteristics. Further, asymmetry indexes were calculated for both datasets. Accuracy of discrimination by a Support Vector Machine and the AAL VOIs was tested against a validated method (PALZ). At the voxel level SMP8 showed a relative hypometabolism in the bilateral precuneus, and posterior cingulate, temporo-parietal and frontal cortices. Discriminant analysis classified subjects with an accuracy ranging between.91 and.83 as a function of data organization. The best values were obtained from a subset of 6 meta-VOIs plus 6 asymmetry values reaching an area under the ROC curve of.947, significantly larger than the one obtained by the PALZ score. High accuracy in discriminating MCI converters from healthy controls was reached by a non-linear classifier based on SVM applied on predefined anatomo-functional regions and inter-hemispheric asymmetries.

The merit of this fusion is that it provides anatomical information for the accurate detection of pathological areas characterized in functional imaging by physiological abnormalities. First, quantification of brain tissue volumes is proposed based on a fusion scheme in three successive steps: modeling, fusion and decision. (1) Modeling which consists of three sub-steps: the initialization of the centroids of the tissue clusters by applying the Bias corrected Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Then, the optimization of the initial partition is performed by running genetic algorithms. Finally, the creation of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissue maps by applying the Possibilistic FCM clustering algorithm. (2) Fusion using a possibilistic operator to merge the maps of the MRI and PET images highlighting redundancies and managing ambiguities. (3) Decision offering more representative anatomo-functional fusion images. Second, a support vector data description (SVDD) classifier is used that must reliably distinguish AD from normal aging and automatically detects outliers. The ""divide and conquer"" strategy is then used, which speeds up the SVDD process and reduces the load and cost of the calculating. The robustness of the tissue quantification process is proven against noise (20% level), partial volume effects and when inhomogeneities of spatial intensity are high. Thus, the superiority of the SVDD classifier over competing conventional systems is also demonstrated with the adoption of the 10-fold cross-validation approach for synthetic datasets (Alzheimer disease neuroimaging (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)) and real images. The percentage of classification in terms of accuracy (%), sensitivity (%), specificity (%) and area under ROC curve was 93.65%, 90.08%, 92.75% and 0.973; 91.46%, 92%, 91.78% and 0.967; 85.09%, 86.41%, 84.92% and 0.946 in the case of the ADNI, OASIS and real images respectively.",0.52739125,0.61462164,0.61721724,0.6744266,0.5246159,0.5037327,0.47693887,0.47885746,0.5339561,0.5709272,0.526531,0.5111802,0.5363809,0.62490344,Computer-aided diagnosis system of alzheimer's disease based on multimodal fusion: Tissue quantification based on the hybrid fuzzy-genetic-possibilistic model and discriminative classification based on the SVDD model,10/1/2019,,Lilia Lazli; Mounir Boukadoum; Otmane Ait Mohamed,Brain Sciences,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074232955&origin=inward,,,,,2019,"@article{,

Regions of the sensorimotor cortex that were activated secondary to hand movement were identified using functional MRI methodology (FMRI). Time courses of low frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in resting brain were observed to have a high degree of temporal correlation (P < 10−3) within these regions and also with time courses in several other regions that can be associated with motor function.

Traditionally, subjects with missing measures are discarded, resulting in a severe loss of available information. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing an incomplete Multi-Source Feature (iMSF) learning method where all the samples (with at least one available data source) can be used. To illustrate the proposed approach, we classify patients from the ADNI study into groups with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal controls, based on the multi-modality data. At baseline, ADNI's 780 participants (172. AD, 397 MCI, 211 NC), have at least one of four data types: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), FDG-PET, CSF and proteomics. These data are used to test our algorithm. Depending on the problem being solved, we divide our samples according to the availability of data sources, and we learn shared sets of features with state-of-the-art sparse learning methods. To build a practical and robust system, we construct a classifier ensemble by combining our method with four other methods for missing value estimation. Comprehensive experiments with various parameters show that our proposed iMSF method and the ensemble model yield stable and promising results. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0.4683256,0.5798349,0.59335166,0.59362334,0.5180428,0.45136085,0.4686356,0.46753988,0.4999426,0.49610472,0.49766463,0.49596584,0.47751355,0.53812766,Multi-source feature learning for joint analysis of incomplete multiple heterogeneous neuroimaging data,7/2/2012,,Lei Yuan; Yalin Wang; Paul M.

So far, the image data input to classifier mainly focus on 2D or 3D images. Although some functional imaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), generate 4D data which contain both spatial and time-varying information of the brain, for the lack of suitable 4D image processing algorithm, these 4D data were always used by transforming them into functional connectivity or slicing them into 2D/3D pictures which causing apparent information loss. In this paper, we present a 4D deep learning model (C3d-LSTM) for AD discrimination, which is able to utilize the spatial and time-varying information simultaneously by dealing with 4D fMRI data directly. The proposed C3d-LSTM combines a series of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial features from each volume of 3D static image in fMRI image sequence. Then the feature maps obtained were put into the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the time-varying information contained in the data. Because of the design of structure, C3d-LSTM became an end-to-end data-driven model, which was more convenient for processing 4D fMRI data. The model proposed conducted on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative dataset for algorithm evaluation compared with controlled experiments. Results showed that using 4D fMRI data directly with the proposed method did make a far better result for AD detection than the methods using functional connectivity, 2D, or 3D fMRI data. It demonstrated our assumption that making the most of the natural spatial and temporal information preserved in 4D fMRI data is significant for AD detection and can increase the performance of the classifier. Meanwhile the result implied that the C3d-LSTM model proposed is a suitable model for processing 4D fMRI data and extracting the spatio-temporal property of fMRI data fully for diagnosis of AD.",0.5166111,0.5662353,0.57444257,0.5996048,0.5384486,0.52429944,0.49127653,0.49012476,0.5179324,0.581691,0.5885655,0.5598103,0.58552283,0.6048456,Detecting Alzheimer's disease Based on 4D fMRI: An exploration under deep learning framework,5/7/2020,,Wei Li; Xuefeng Lin; Xi Chen,Neurocomputing,76,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078401515&origin=inward,,,,280-287,2020,"@article{,

However, to translate PPPM into clinical practice, it is of utmost importance that AI-based models are carefully validated. The validation process comprises several steps, one of which is testing the model on patient-level data from an independent clinical cohort study. However, recruitment criteria can bias statistical analysis of cohort study data and impede model application beyond the training data. To evaluate whether and how data from independent clinical cohort studies differ from each other, this study systematically compares the datasets collected from two major dementia cohorts, namely, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and AddNeuroMed. The presented comparison was conducted on individual feature level and revealed significant differences among both cohorts. Such systematic deviations can potentially hamper the generalizability of results which were based on a single cohort dataset. Despite identified differences, validation of a previously published, ADNI trained model for prediction of personalized dementia risk scores on 244 AddNeuroMed subjects was successful: External validation resulted in a high prediction performance of above 80% area under receiver operator characteristic curve up to 6 years before dementia diagnosis. Propensity score matching identified a subset of patients from AddNeuroMed, which showed significantly smaller demographic differences to ADNI. For these patients, an even higher prediction performance was achieved, which demonstrates the influence systematic differences between cohorts can have on validation results. In conclusion, this study exposes challenges in external validation of AI models on cohort study data and is one of the rare cases in the neurology field in which such external validation was performed.

In the proposed method, we impose low-rank constraint on the regression coefficient matrix, which is composed of regression coefficient vectors of all modalities. Meanwhile, we adaptively evaluate the contribution of each sample to the fusion model by self-paced learning (SPL).

Detecting Alzheimer's disease using multimodality data has two difficulties: (1) there exists noise information in multimodal data; (2) how to establish an effective mathematical model of the relationship between multimodal data? To this end, we proposed a method named LDF which is based on the combination of low-rank representation and discriminant correlation analysis (DCA) to fuse multimodal datasets. Specifically, the low-rank representation method is used to extract the latent features of the submodal data, so the noise information in the submodal data is removed.

This shortcoming can be explained by the relatively small number of available labeled subjects, the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, and difficulties in interpreting the results of deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a simple 3D Convolutional Neural Networks and exploit its model parameters to tailor the end-to-end architecture for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

However, most existing multi-template based methods simply average or concatenate multiple sets of features extracted from different templates, which potentially ignores important structural information contained in the multi-template data. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel relationship induced multi-template learning method for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), by explicitly modeling structural information in the multi-template data. Specifically, we first nonlinearly register each brain's magnetic resonance (MR) image separately onto multiple pre-selected templates, and then extract multiple sets of features for this MR image. Next, we develop a novel feature selection algorithm by introducing two regularization terms to model the relationships among templates and among individual subjects. Using these selected features corresponding to multiple templates, we then construct multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Finally, an ensemble classification is used to combine outputs of all SVM classifiers, for achieving the final result. We evaluate our proposed method on 459 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 97 AD patients, 128 normal controls (NC), 117 progressive MCI (pMCI) patients, and 117 stable MCI (sMCI) patients.

Besides, many researches have proven that the feature selection method, which also considers the relationship among features, shows improvements in performance for AD diagnosis. However, most existing feature selection methods only consider the pairwise correlation between features. Instead, when adopting these features to diagnose the AD, the high-order correlated relationships among features need to be taken more into consideration. In this paper, a novel classification framework for diagnosing the AD and MCI has been proposed to address these problems. This framework mainly consists of three processes: feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The feature extraction is mainly used to extract texture features and morphometric features from brain MR images. The feature selection process is to select discriminative features. This process firstly measures the high-order correlation among features by borrowing the idea of hypergraph theory and then to generate the optimal feature subset based on the high-order correlation. The classification process will adopt the feature subset to finish the classification task. The main contribution of this framework is to consider the high-order correlation among features instead of pairwise correlation when classifying the AD. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI database shows that the proposed method obtains better performance than other state-of-the-art counterpart methods.

Effective prediction of such conversion from MCI to AD is of great importance for early diagnosis of AD and also for evaluating AD risk pre-symptomatically. Unlike most previous methods that used only the samples from a target domain to train a classifier, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal manifold-regularized transfer learning (M2TL) method that jointly utilizes samples from another domain (e.g., AD vs. normal controls (NC)) as well as unlabeled samples to boost the performance of the MCI conversion prediction. Specifically, the proposed M2TL method includes two key components. The first one is a kernel-based maximum mean discrepancy criterion, which helps eliminate the potential negative effect induced by the distributional difference between the auxiliary domain (i.e., AD and NC) and the target domain (i.e., MCI converters (MCI-C) and MCI non-converters (MCI-NC)). The second one is a semi-supervised multimodal manifold-regularized least squares classification method, where the target-domain samples, the auxiliary-domain samples, and the unlabeled samples can be jointly used for training our classifier. Furthermore, with the integration of a group sparsity constraint into our objective function, the proposed M2TL has a capability of selecting the informative samples to build a robust classifier. Experimental results on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by significantly improving the classification accuracy of 80.1 % for MCI conversion prediction, and also outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.",0.4762017,0.52732307,0.5742875,0.5290367,0.57079995,0.43917114,0.53707415,0.5216248,0.49040523,0.48122326,0.49096996,0.47139668,0.48198965,0.49787837,Multimodal manifold-regularized transfer learning for MCI conversion prediction,12/1/2015,,Bo Cheng; Mingxia Liu; Heung Il Suk; Dinggang Shen; Daoqiang Zhang,Brain Imaging and Behavior,78,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84948567283&origin=inward,,,,913-926,2015,"@article{,

In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for discriminative feature extraction for motor imagery classification in an EEG-based BCI in which the class-discriminative frequency bands and the corresponding spatial filters are optimized by means of the probabilistic and information-theoretic approaches. In our framework, the problem of simultaneous spatiospectral filter optimization is formulated as the estimation of an unknown posterior probability density function (pdf) that represents the probability that a single-trial EEG of predefined mental tasks can be discriminated in a state. In order to estimate the posterior pdf, we propose a particle-based approximation method by extending a factored-sampling technique with a diffusion process. An information-theoretic observation model is also devised to measure discriminative power of features between classes. From the viewpoint of classifier design, the proposed method naturally allows us to construct a spectrally weighted label decision rule by linearly combining the outputs from multiple classifiers. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method by analyzing the results and its success on three public databases. © 2012 IEEE.",0.3766522,0.41439945,0.4003368,0.34597522,0.3579536,0.3175434,0.3812826,0.37890768,0.37509722,0.38692382,0.39725643,0.37218302,0.35417002,0.4239127,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

As hippocampus is known to be among the first areas affected by the disease, fast and robust definition of hippocampus volume would be of great importance in the clinical decision making. We propose a method for computing automatically the volume of hippocampus using a modified multi-atlas segmentation framework, including an improved initialization of the framework and the correction of partial volume effect. The method produced a high similarity index, 0.87, and correlation coefficient, 0.94, with semi-automatically generated segmentations. When comparing hippocampus volumes extracted from 1.5. T and 3. T images, the absolute value of the difference was low: 3.2% of the volume. The correct classification rate for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal cases was about 80% while the accuracy 65% was obtained for classifying stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment cases. The method was evaluated in three cohorts consisting altogether about 1000 cases, the main emphasis being in the analysis of the ADNI cohort. The computation time of the method is about 2 minutes on a standard laptop computer.

While considering the theoretical background from past studies we are trying to identify convolutional neural network (CNN) behaviors moving from 2D to 3D architecture. This study aims to explore the output from a variety of CNN models implemented in the MRI or/and PET classification tasks for AD prediction while trying to summarize its characteristics with a variety of parameters that are tuned and changed. There are many architectures available; however we are testing a basic architecture with a change in the reception area based on the convolutional layer's kernel size and its strides. The architecture has been categorized as converging diverging or equivalent if the filter kernel size is unchanged. This investigation studies a simple encoder based CNN with a sequential flow of features from low-level to high-level feature extraction. The idea is to present a diverging reception area by increasing the filter size and stride from a lower to a higher level. As a result the feature redundancy is reduced and the trivial features keep on diminishing. The proposed architecture is referred to as 'divNet' and several experiments were performed to determine how effective the architecture is in terms of the consumed memory the number of parameters running time classification error and the generalization error. This study surveys several related experiments by changing the hyper-parameters setting the architecture selection based on the depth and area of the reception feature and the data size.,0.53743637,0.52801824,0.5547841,0.57218057,0.56509477,0.53054523,0.5445,0.5468328,0.5283385,0.62407345,0.61153275,0.56415826,0.6630889,0.57323134,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid system to classify a given MR brain image as either normal or abnormal. The proposed method first employed digital wavelet transform to extract features then used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space. Afterwards, we constructed a kernel support vector machine (KSVM) with RBF kernel, using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize the parameters C and σ. Fivefold cross-validation was utilized to avoid overfitting. In the experimental procedure, we created a 90 images dataset brain downloaded from Harvard Medical School website. The abnormal brain MR images consist of the following diseases: glioma, metastatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, meningioma, sarcoma, Alzheimer, Huntington, motor neuron disease, cerebral calcinosis, Pick's disease, Alzheimer plus visual agnosia, multiple sclerosis, AIDS dementia, Lyme encephalopathy, herpes encephalitis, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, and cerebral toxoplasmosis. The 5-folded cross-validation classification results showed that our method achieved 97.78% classification accuracy, higher than 86.22% by BP-NN and 91.33% by RBF-NN. For the parameter selection, we compared PSO with those of random selection method. The results showed that the PSO is more effective to build optimal KSVM. © 2013 Yudong Zhang et al.",0.44565916,0.4942498,0.47460404,0.41935277,0.42493168,0.41226634,0.42652696,0.4211458,0.44895756,0.4782669,0.48050424,0.457148,0.45277917,0.5737068,An MR brain images classifier system via particle swarm optimization and kernel support vector machine,10/21/2013,,Yudong Zhang; Shuihua Wang; Genlin Ji; Zhengchao Dong,The Scientific World Journal,121,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84885597453&origin=inward,,,,,2013,"@article{,

Recently many different and innovative methods have been proposed to improve upon this technology. In this study, we presented a hybrid method based on forward neural network (FNN) to classify an MR brain image as normal or abnormal. The method first employed a discrete wavelet transform to extract features from images, and then applied the technique of principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the size of the features. The reduced features were sent to an FNN, of which the parameters were optimized via an improved artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm based on both fitness scaling and chaotic theory. We referred to the improved algorithm as scaled chaotic artificial bee colony (SCABC). Moreover, the K-fold stratified cross validation was employed to avoid overfitting. In the experiment, we applied the proposed method on the data set of T2-weighted MRI images consisting of 66 brain images (18 normal and 48 abnormal). The proposed SCABC was compared with traditional training methods such as BP, momentum BP, genetic algorithm, elite genetic algorithm with migration, simulated annealing, and ABC. Each algorithm was run 20 times to reduce randomness. The results show that our SCABC can obtain the least mean MSE and 100% classification accuracy. © 2011 EMW Publishing.",0.44711503,0.4954391,0.47221136,0.4395105,0.4250905,0.38199213,0.42458776,0.43011189,0.4359622,0.47807732,0.47224897,0.44868585,0.46638444,0.5693087,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

In this paper, we solve for the first time a direct four-class classification problem, namely, AD, Normal Control (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI) by processing Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) in 3D. DTI provides information on brain anatomy in form of Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) along with Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) intensities. We separately train CNNs, more specifically, VoxCNNs on FA values, MD values, and EPI intensities on 3D DTI scan volumes. In addition, we feed average FA and MD values for each brain region, derived according to the Colin27 brain atlas, into a random forest classifier (RFC). These four (three separately trained VoxCNNs and one RFC) models are first applied in isolation for the above four-class classification problem. Individual classification results are then fused at the decision level using a modulated rank averaging strategy leading to a classification accuracy of 92.6%.

We provide an example of ACC using computational techniques within the context of cross-sectional analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRI) in neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's dementia (AD). In this paper, the accuracy of our ACC methodology is assessed when presented with real life, imperfect data, i.e., cohorts of MRI with varying acquisition parameters and imaging quality. The comparative methodology uses the Jacobian determinants derived from dense deformation fields and scaled grey-level intensity from a selected volume of interest centered on the medial temporal lobe. The ACC performance is assessed in a series of leave-one-out experiments aimed at separating 75 probable AD and 75 age-matched normal controls. The resulting accuracy is 92% using a support vector machine classifier based on least squares optimization.

We applied principal component analysis to deformation maps derived from MRI scans of 32 AD patients, 18 elderly healthy controls and 24 MCI patients. Principal component scores were used to discriminate between AD patients and controls and between MCI converters and MCI non-converters. We found a significant regional pattern of atrophy (p < 0.001) in medial temporal lobes, neocortical association areas, thalamus and basal ganglia and corresponding widening of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces (p < 0.001) in AD patients compared to controls. Accuracy was 81% for CSF- and 83% for brain-based deformation maps to separate AD patients from controls. Nine out of 24 MCI patients converted to AD during clinical follow-up. Discrimination between MCI converters and non-converters reached 80% accuracy based on CSF maps and 73% accuracy based on brain maps. In a logistic regression model, principal component scores based on CSF maps predicted clinical outcome in MCI patients even after controlling for age, gender, MMSE score and time of follow-up.

They generate regional volumes, cortical thickness measures and other measures, which can be used as input for multivariate analysis. It is not clear which combination of measures and normalization approach are most useful for AD classification and to predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion. The current study includes MRI scans from 699 subjects [AD, MCI and controls (CTL)] from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The Freesurfer pipeline was used to generate regional volume, cortical thickness, gray matter volume, surface area, mean curvature, gaussian curvature, folding index and curvature index measures. 259 variables were used for orthogonal partial least square to latent structures (OPLS) multivariate analysis. Normalisation approaches were explored and the optimal combination of measures determined. Results indicate that cortical thickness measures should not be normalized, while volumes should probably be normalized by intracranial volume (ICV). Combining regional cortical thickness measures (not normalized) with cortical and subcortical volumes (normalized with ICV) using OPLS gave a prediction accuracy of 91.5 % when distinguishing AD versus CTL. This model prospectively predicted future decline from MCI to AD with 75.9 % of converters correctly classified.

The development of an automation process will help in identifying the Alzheimer disease (AD). The maximum distinctive AD related to neuronal loss in the brain sub regions is GM, WM, CC and HC. Several nature optimization algorithms are being developed to get an optimum solution for segmenting these kinds of very hectic regions. In this work, brain sub regions have been considered to diagnose the AD using four various optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Cuckoo Search (CS). Among these optimization techniques, GWO shows promising results due to the proper selection of global optimum solution. The segmented regions have been classified using deep learning classifier and it has been validated with Ground Truth (GT) images. The results prove that GWO is capable to segment the brain sub regions with high accuracy of 98% similarity among the ground truth and segmented region. Then, the segmented regions are classified using deep learning classifier and the results show the high accuracy of 95%. From the above sub regions, HC proves better classification accuracy of 95%, sensitivity as 95% and specificity as 94% compared to all other regions.

The aim of this work is to develop a seizure detection system with high accuracy.

Compared with computing the single fractal dimension, multifractal analysis can provide a better description on the transient behavior of EEG fractal time series during the evolvement from interictal stage to seizures. Thus both interictal EEG and ictal EEG were analyzed by multifractal formalism and their differences in the multifractal features were used to distinguish the two class of EEG and detect seizures. In the proposed detection system, eight features (α 0, α min, α max, Δα, f(α min), f(α max), Δf and R) were extracted from the multifractal spectrums of the preprocessed EEG to construct feature vectors.

Seventy percent of cases are due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and there is a 10–20 year ’pre-clinical’ period before significant cognitive decline occurs. We urgently need, cost effective, objective biomarkers to detect AD, and other dementias, at an early stage. Risk factor modification could prevent 40% of cases and drug trials would have greater chances of success if participants are recruited at an earlier stage. Currently, detection of dementia is largely by pen and paper cognitive tests but these are time consuming and insensitive to the pre-clinical phase. Specialist brain scans and body fluid biomarkers can detect the earliest stages of dementia but are too invasive or expensive for widespread use. With the advancement of technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promising results in assisting with detection of early-stage dementia. This scoping review aims to summarise the current capabilities of AI-aided digital biomarkers to aid in early detection of dementia, and also discusses potential future research directions. Methods & Materials: In this scoping review, we used PubMed and IEEE Xplore to identify relevant papers. The resulting records were further filtered to retrieve articles published within five years and written in English. Duplicates were removed, titles and abstracts were screened and full texts were reviewed. Results: After an initial yield of 1,463 records, 1,444 records were screened after removal of duplication. A further 771 records were excluded after screening titles and abstracts, and 496 were excluded after full text review. The final yield was 177 studies. Records were grouped into different artificial intelligence based tests: (a) computerized cognitive tests (b) movement tests (c) speech, conversion, and language tests and (d) computer-assisted interpretation of brain scans. Conclusions: In general, AI techniques enhance the performance of dementia screening tests because more features can be retrieved from a single test, there are less errors due to subjective judgements and AI shifts the automation of dementia screening to a higher level. Compared with traditional cognitive tests, AI-based computerized cognitive tests improve the discrimination sensitivity by around 4% and specificity by around 3%. In terms of speech, conversation and language tests, combining both acoustic features and linguistic features achieve the best result with accuracy around 94%. Deep learning techniques applied in brain scan analysis achieves around 92% accuracy. Movement tests and setting smart environments to capture daily life behaviours are two potential future directions that may help discriminate dementia from normal aging.

In developed countries, the Alzheimer's disease is one of the most financially costly diseases due to the requirement of continuous treatments as well as the need of assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities as time goes by. The objective of this work is to present an automated approach for classifying the Alzheimer's disease from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patient brain scans. The method is fast and reliable for a suitable and straightforward deploy in clinical applications for helping diagnosing and improving the efficacy of medical treatments by recognising the disease state of the patient. Methods Many features can be extracted from magnetic resonance images, but most are not suitable for the classification task. Therefore, we propose a new feature extraction technique from patients’ MRI brain scans that is based on a recent computer vision method, called Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF. The extracted features are processed with the definition and the combination of two new metrics, i.e., their spatial position and their distribution around the patient's brain, and given as input to a function-based classifier (i.e., Support Vector Machines). Results We report the comparison with recent state-of-the-art approaches on two established medical data sets (ADNI and OASIS). In the case of binary classification (case vs control), our proposed approach outperforms most state-of-the-art techniques, while having comparable results with the others. Specifically, we obtain 100% (97%) of accuracy, 100% (97%) sensitivity and 99% (93%) specificity for the ADNI (OASIS) data set. When dealing with three or four classes (i.e., classification of all subjects) our method is the only one that reaches remarkable performance in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, in the ADNI data set we obtain a classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99% while in the OASIS data set a classification accuracy and sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 79% when dealing with four classes.

A major problem encountered in the classification of MRI for the automatic diagnosis of AD is the so-called curse-of-dimensionality, which is a consequence of the high dimensionality of MRI feature vectors and the low number of training patterns available in most MRI datasets relevant to AD. Methods: A method for performing early diagnosis of AD is proposed that combines a set of SVMs trained on different texture descriptors (which reduce dimensionality) extracted from slices of Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) with a set of SVMs trained on markers built from the voxels of MRIs. The dimension of the voxel-based features is reduced by using different feature selection algorithms, each of which trains a separate SVM. These two sets of SVMs are then combined by weighted-sum rule for a final decision. Results: Experimental results show that 2D texture descriptors improve the performance of state-of-the-art voxel-based methods. The evaluation of our system on the four ADNI datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed ensemble and demonstrates a contribution to the accurate prediction of AD. Conclusions: Ensembles of texture descriptors combine partially uncorrelated information with respect to standard approaches based on voxels, feature selection, and classification by SVM. In other words, the fusion of a system based on voxels and an ensemble of texture descriptors enhances the performance of voxel-based approaches.",0.51914525,0.6360543,0.59477264,0.5656808,0.5182998,0.45652795,0.45521364,0.44802028,0.5244433,0.5464971,0.53300023,0.5101875,0.50865865,0.5523026,Texture descriptors and voxels for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,6/1/2019,,Loris Nanni; Sheryl Brahnam; Christian Salvatore; Isabella Castiglioni,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,37,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065903165&origin=inward,,,,19-26,2019,"@article{,

Currently, although there is no effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease, early detection of dementia through magnetic resonance imaging analysis may assist in developing preventive measures to slow disease progression. In this paper, we developed an automated machine learning method for classifying cognitively normal aging, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease individuals. Materials and methods: In this study, a total of 1167 whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging scans of individuals who are cognitively normal aging controls, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. We measured regional cortical thickness of both left and right hemispheres (68 features) using FreeSurfer analysis for each individual, and utilized these 68 features for model building. We further tested scans of individuals to classify them into four groups using various machine learning methods. Results: We found that the cortical thickness feature, based on the non-linear support vector machine classifier with radial basis function, showed the highest specificity (0.77), sensitivity (0.75), F-score (0.72), Matthew's correlation coefficient (0.71), Kappa-statistic (0.69), receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (0.76), and an overall accuracy of 75% in classifying all four groups using ten-fold cross-validation with respect to the clinical scale. In addition, we also predicted the features for classifying all four groups using the support vector regression algorithm. Conclusion: The non-linear support vector machine using a radial basis function kernel showed good accuracy in classifying different stages of dementia. Thus, machine learning methods are useful for radiological imaging tasks such as diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, and early detection.",0.5201999,0.5611453,0.5569952,0.5345716,0.52999187,0.50988543,0.51182204,0.49995512,0.53653824,0.5449882,0.5625153,0.5151212,0.5488575,0.614303,"Automatic classification of cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease using structural MRI analysis",1/1/2020,,V.

The simultaneous use of multi-modality data has been demonstrated to be helpful for more accurate identification. The current study focused on extending a multi-modality algorithm and evaluating the method by identifying AD/MCI. Methods: In this study, sparse representation-based classification (SRC), a well-developed method in pattern recognition and machine learning, was extended to a multi-modality classification framework named as weighted multi-modality SRC (wmSRC). Data including three modalities of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and florbetapir PET from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were adopted for AD/MCI classification (113 AD patients, 110 MCI patients and 117 NC subjects). Results: Adopting wmSRC, the classification accuracy achieved 94.8% for AD vs. NC, 74.5% for MCI vs. NC, and 77.8% for progressive MCI vs. stable MCI, superior to or comparable with the results of some other state-of-the-art models in recent multi-modality researches.

However, in the diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), this identical-distribution assumption may not hold. To solve this problem, we utilize the transfer learning method into the diagnosis of AD. Methods: The MR (Magnetic Resonance) images were segmented using spm-Dartel toolbox and registrated with Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas, then the gray matter (GM) tissue volume of the anatomical region were computed as characteristic parameter. The information gain was introduced for feature selection. The TrAdaboost algorithm was used to classify AD, MCI, and normal controls (NC) data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, meanwhile, the ""knowledge"" learned from ADNI was transferred to AD samples from local hospital. The classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated and compared with four classical algorithms. Results: In the experiment of transfer task: AD to MCI, 177 AD and 40NC subjects were grouped as training data; 245 MCI and 45 remaining NC subjects were combined as testing data, the highest accuracy achieved 85.4%, higher than the other four classical algorithms. Meanwhile, feature selection that is based on information gain reduced the features from 90 to 7, controlled the redundancy efficiently. In the experiment of transfer task: ADNI to local hospital data, the highest accuracy achieved 93.7%, and the specificity achieved 100%.

Though current DLB diagnostic criteria employ several indicative biomarkers, relative preservation of the medial temporal lobe as revealed by structural MRI suffers from low sensitivity and specificity, making them unreliable as sole supporting biomarkers. In this study, we investigated how a deep learning approach would be able to differentiate DLB from AD with structural MRI data. Methods: Two-hundred and eight patients (101 DLB, 69 AD, and 38 controls) participated in this retrospective study. Gray matter images were extracted using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). In order to compare the conventional statistical analysis with deep-learning feature extraction, we built a classification model for DLB and AD with a residual neural network (ResNet) type of convolutional neural network architecture, which is one of the deep learning models. The anatomically standardized gray matter images extracted in the same way as for the VBM process were used as inputs, and the classification performance achieved by our model was evaluated. Results: Conventional statistical analysis detected no significant atrophy other than fine differences on the middle temporal pole and hippocampal regions. The feature extracted by the deep learning method differentiated DLB from AD with 79.15％ accuracy compared to the 68.41% of the conventional method.

Our aim was to combine MR imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers in the diagnostic classification and 2-year prognosis of MCI and AD, by examining the following: 1) which measures are most sensitive to diagnostic status, 2) to what extent the methods provide unique information in diagnostic classification, and 3) which measures are most predictive of clinical decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ADNI baseline MR imaging, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 42 controls, 73 patients with MCI, and 38 patients with AD; and 2-year clinical follow-up data for 36 controls, 51 patients with MCI, and 25 patients with AD were analyzed. The hippocampus and entorhinal, parahippocampal, retrosplenial, precuneus, inferior parietal, supramarginal, middle temporal, lateral, and medial orbitofrontal cortices were used as regions of interest. CSF variables included Aβ42, t-tau, p-tau, and ratios of t-tau/Aβ42 and p-tau/Aβ42. Regression analyses were performed to determine the sensitivity of measures to diagnostic status as well as 2-year change in CDR-SB, MMSE, and delayed logical memory in MCI. RESULTS: Hippocampal volume, retrosplenial thickness, and t-tau/Aβ42 uniquely predicted diagnostic group. Change in CDR-SB was best predicted by retrosplenial thickness; MMSE, by retrosplenial metabolism and thickness; and delayed logical memory, by hippocampal volume. CONCLUSIONS: All biomarkers were sensitive to the diagnostic group. Combining MR imaging morphometry and CSF biomarkers improved diagnostic classification (controls versus AD).

Our aim was to develop and validate a deep learning-based automatic brain segmentation and classification algorithm for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease using 3D T1-weighted brain MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A deep learning-based algorithm was developed using a dataset of T1-weighted brain MR images in consecutive patients with Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment. We developed a 2-step algorithm using a convolutional neural network to perform brain parcellation followed by 3 classifier techniques including XGBoost for disease prediction. All classification experiments were performed using 5-fold cross-validation. The diagnostic performance of the XGBoost method was compared with logistic regression and a linear Support Vector Machine by calculating their areas under the curve for differentiating Alzheimer disease from mild cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment from healthy controls. RESULTS: In a total of 4 datasets, 1099, 212, 711, and 705 eligible patients were included. Compared with the linear Support Vector Machine and logistic regression, XGBoost significantly improved the prediction of Alzheimer disease (P,.001). In terms of differentiating Alzheimer disease from mild cognitive impairment, the 3 algorithms resulted in areas under the curve of 0.758-0.825. XGBoost had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 70%. In terms of differentiating mild cognitive impairment from the healthy control group, the 3 algorithms resulted in areas under the curve of 0.668-0.870.

Support vector machine (SVM) automatic classifiers using 3D T1 MRI were trained to distinguish: LOAD vs. Depression, FTD vs. LOAD, EOAD vs. Depression, EOAD vs. FTD. We extracted SVM weight maps, which are tridimensional representations of discriminant atrophy patterns used by the classifier to take its decisions and we printed posters of these maps. Four radiologists (2 senior neuroradiologists and 2 unspecialized junior radiologists) performed a visual classification of the 4 diagnostic pairs using 3D T1 MRI. Classifications were performed twice: first with standard radiological reading and then using SVM weight maps as a guide. Results: Diagnostic performance was significantly improved by the use of the weight maps for the two junior radiologists in the case of FTD vs. EOAD.

We sought to delineate the specific patterns of cerebral gray matter loss with regard to onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by using MR imaging and VBM and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of VBM with Z score images. METHODS: Two groups of 30 patients with mild AD of different ages of onset were examined. Mean ages in the early- and late-onset groups were 60.2 ± 5.2 and 71.5 ± 2.6 years, respectively. Control subjects were aged-matched healthy volunteers. Regions of gray matter loss in early-and late-onset AD were examined with VBM. Diagnostic performance of Z score images obtained with the VBM method was evaluated in patients and control subjects by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az). RESULTS: Both AD groups had significantly reduced gray matter in the bilateral medial temporal regions. In addition, the early-onset group had more severe gray matter loss in the bilateral parietal and posterior cingulate cortices and precuneus region. No difference was noted in diagnostic performance of Z score images between the early- (Az = 0.9435) and late-onset (Az = 0.9018) groups. CONCLUSION: Differences were noted in the patterns of regional gray matter loss in patients with early-onset AD versus those with late-onset AD. Parietotemporal and posterior cingulate gray matter loss was found in early-onset AD but not in late-onset AD. Z score images obtained with VBM had a great diagnostic performance for mild AD and can be applied for detecting mild AD in clinical examinations. © American Society of Neuroradiology.",0.43045735,0.4436018,0.41687688,0.4555057,0.43176323,0.35764393,0.41106698,0.39030358,0.4703697,0.4289338,0.43787998,0.42356402,0.42842185,0.48228234,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

We propose a pixelwise background modeling and subtraction technique using multiple features, where generative and discriminative techniques are combined for classification. In our algorithm, color, gradient, and Haar-like features are integrated to handle spatio-temporal variations for each pixel. A pixelwise generative background model is obtained for each feature efficiently and effectively by Kernel Density Approximation (KDA). Background subtraction is performed in a discriminative manner using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) over background likelihood vectors for a set of features. The proposed algorithm is robust to shadow, illumination changes, spatial variations of background.

Fractal dimension (FD) analysis, a measure of shape complexity, has been proven useful in MRI but its application to fluorine-18 amyloid PET has not yet been demonstrated. Shannon entropy (SE) has also been proposed as a measure of image complexity in DTI imaging, but it is not yet widely used in radiology. Materials and methods In this study, one volumetric FD method and one volumetric SE method were applied to fluorine-18-flutemetamol and fluorine-18-florbetapir 3D amyloid images from 65 and 281 participants, respectively, including healthy volunteers, and patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Results The group average FD of white matter surface and SE of white matter volume for healthy volunteers were higher than for pAD patients. Both FD and SE are effective in the identification of MCI patients who progress to pAD during the 2-year follow-up (ground truth). Finally, we developed a support vector machine multimodal classification framework using both PET and MRI features, which showed higher accuracy compared to traditional standard uptake value ratio or using PET alone. The classification accuracy for flutemetamol and florbetapir is 88.9 and 83.3%, respectively, for MCI progression, which is competitive with existing literature.

Diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) early facilitates family planning and cost control. The purpose of this study is to predict the presence of AD using socio-demographic, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Early detection of AD enables family planning and may reduce costs by delaying long-term care. Accurate, non-imagery methods also reduce patient costs. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1) cross-sectional MRI data were analyzed. A gradient boosted machine (GBM) predicted the presence of AD as a function of gender, age, education, socioeconomic status (SES), and a mini-mental state exam (MMSE). A residual network with 50 layers (ResNet-50) predicted the clinical dementia rating (CDR) presence and severity from MRI’s (multi-class classification). The GBM achieved a mean 91.3% prediction accuracy (10-fold stratified cross validation) for dichotomous CDR using socio-demographic and MMSE variables. MMSE was the most important feature. ResNet-50 using image generation techniques based on an 80% training set resulted in 98.99% three class prediction accuracy on 4139 images (20% validation set) at Epoch 133 and nearly perfect multi-class predication accuracy on the training set (99.34%).

Recently, there has been great interest in computer-aided diagnosis in magnetic resonance image (MRI) classification. However, distinguishing between Alzheimer's brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 60) is challenging because of their highly similar brain patterns and image intensities. Recently, cutting-edge feature extraction technologies have found extensive application in numerous fields, including medical image analysis. Here, we propose a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) for extracting features from an image. The dimensionality of feature vector is reduced by using principal component analysis (PCA). The reduced feature vector is sent to feed-forward neural network (FNN) to distinguish AD and HC from the input MR images. These proposed and implemented pipelines, which demonstrate improvements in classification output when compared to that of recent studies, resulted in high and reproducible accuracy rates of 90.06 ± 0.01% with a sensitivity of 92.00 ± 0.04%, a specificity of 87.78 ± 0.04%, and a precision of 89.6 ± 0.03% with 10-fold cross-validation.",0.5335964,0.54903,0.5481054,0.5177392,0.54773057,0.5377248,0.52187407,0.5153719,0.56307983,0.5618177,0.58552957,0.54937685,0.5646626,0.6201003,"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform, PCA, and Feed-Forward Neural Network",6/21/2017,,Debesh Jha; Ji In Kim; Goo Rak Kwon,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,78,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85022029618&origin=inward,,,,,2017,"@article{,

Methods Colour maps of ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness, superficial capillary plexus (SCP) optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images, and ultra-widefield (UWF) colour and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) scanning laser ophthalmoscopy images were captured in individuals with AD or healthy cognition. A CNN to predict AD diagnosis was developed using multimodal retinal images, OCT and OCTA quantitative data, and patient data. Results 284 eyes of 159 subjects (222 eyes from 123 cognitively healthy subjects and 62 eyes from 36 subjects with AD) were used to develop the model. Area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for predicted probability of AD for the independent test set varied by input used: UWF colour AUC 0.450 (95% CI 0.282, 0.592), OCTA SCP 0.582 (95% CI 0.440, 0.724), UWF FAF 0.618 (95% CI 0.462, 0.773), GC-IPL maps 0.809 (95% CI 0.700, 0.919).

Methods: We longitudinally evaluated 269 elderly subjects who did not meet formal criteria for MCI at baseline but had: (1) a clinical history suggesting MCI without neuropsychological deficits (PreMCI-Clinical); or (2) neuropsychological deficits on one or more memory measures in conjunction with a negative clinical examination (amnestic PreMCI-NP) or were normal on both neuropsychological and clinical examination. Results: The rate of progression to MCI or dementia over an average of 2- to 3 years was 3.7% for no cognitive impairment subjects, whereas it was significantly greater for all PreMCI subtypes (22.0% for PreMCI-Clinical, 38.9% for amnestic PreMCI-NP subjects with two or more memory impairments). Among PreMCI subjects as a whole, lower baseline scores on object memory and category fluency tests were the best predictors of progression to MCI or dementia. Cardiovascular risk factors, Parkinsonian symptoms, and hippocampal atrophy were not associated with progression. Conclusion: Distinct PreMCI subtypes defined on the basis of clinical and neuropsychological evaluations were found to have distinct characteristics, but both subtypes demonstrated elevated risk for progression to MCI or dementia. Despite the lack of evidence of clinical impairment, subjects with neuropsychological deficits in two memory domains were particularly at increased risk for progression of their deficits. © 2012 The Alzheimer's Association.

Some of the collected data were shared with third-party researchers. However, this data was incomplete, erroneous, and lacking in interoperability. Objective: To provide the research community with an accessible, multimodal, patient-level AD cohort dataset. Methods: We systematically addressed several limitations of the originally shared resources and provided additional unreleased data to enhance the dataset. Results: In this work, we publish and describe ANMerge, a new version of the AddNeuroMed dataset. ANMerge includes multimodal data from 1,702 study participants and is accessible to the research community via a centralized portal.

885,https://doi.org/11218956,8.18E-05,1,0,"BACKGROUND: ADAS was designed to measure the severity of the most important symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its subscale ADAS-cog is the most popular cognitive testing instrument used in clinical trials of nootropics. It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. AIM: The aim of the study is to verify the Slovak adaptation of ADAS-cog and its ability to distinguish patients with AD from those with depressive disorders (DD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study sample consists of 29 psychiatric inpatients divided into 2 groups: the AD group of 14 patients (4 males, 10 females, mean age 73.9 +/- 7.3 yrs) fulfilling NINCDS-ADRDA criteria of probable AD and the DD group of 15 subjects (6 males, 9 females, mean age 74.3 +/- 6.5 yrs) without any cognitive impairment. In all patients the ADAS-cog and SMMSE were administered. We compared the group in: total scores in both scales, task scores in the ADAS-cog and the scores of 3 ADAS-cog factors--memory, language and praxis. RESULTS: Both methods distinguished the patients with the AD from DD (p < 0.001 for both scales). Also other variables (task and factor scores of ADAS-cog) reflect the worse results of the AD group. The most evident differences between the diagnostic groups were found in the orientation and constructive praxis. The education level did not affect the scores of the ADAS-cog in the AD patients but it did in SMMSE scores in the DD group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The Slovak version of ADAS-cog has distinguished the patients with the AD from those with DD. The most evident differences between the groups were found in orientation and visuo-constructive praxis. In DD patients, the risk of false positive findings in subjects with lower education is higher than in the AD patients. In comparison with the SMMSE, ADAS-cog seems to be more helpful in early diagnostics of AD.

To establish whether classification performance differs depending on the choice of atlases, support vector machine (SVM)-based classification using different brain atlases was performed. New method: Seventy-seven three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI data sets of subjects with amnestic MCI, including 39 subjects who developed AD (MCI-C) within three years and 38 who did not (MCI-NC), were used for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses and analyzed using SVM-based pattern recognition methods combined with a feature selection method based on the SVM recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. Three brain atlases were used for the feature selections: the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) Atlas, Brodmann's Areas (BA), and the LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40). Results: The VBM analysis showed a significant cluster of gray matter density reduction, located at the left hippocampal region, in MCI-C compared to MCI-NC. The SVM analyses with the SVM-RFE algorithm revealed that the best classification performance was achieved by LPBA40 with 37 selected features, giving an accuracy of 77.9%. The overall performance in LPBA40 was better than that of AAL and BA regardless of the number of selected features. Conclusions: These results suggest that feature selection is crucial to improve the classification performance in atlas-based analysis and that the choice of atlases is also important. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",0.5352126,0.5434131,0.55122834,0.5093218,0.5289237,0.40014204,0.5081634,0.4959447,0.5390295,0.5293641,0.50268805,0.4771769,0.52306265,0.5950267,A comparison of three brain atlases for MCI prediction,1/15/2014,,Kenichi Ota; Naoya Oishi; Kengo Ito; Hidenao Fukuyama,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,46,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84886826442&origin=inward,,,,139-150,2014,"@article{,

Reported are MRI findings of a Phase lia immunotherapy trial in AD prematurely terminated owing to meningoencephalitis in a subset of patients. Objective: To assess cerebral volume changes in patients immunized with AN1792 (β-amyloid [Aβ] 1 to 42) who were antibody responders (anti-AN1792 IgG titer of ≥1:2,200) compared with placebo patients. Methods: This randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of AN1792 225 μg plus QS-21 50 μg included 372 patients with probable AD. Patients received one to three injections of AN1792/QS-21 or saline and were assessed for 12 months. Volumetric MRI was performed pre dose and at month 12 or early termination. Brain, ventricular, and hippocampal volume changes were measured from registered scan pairs. Results: Two hundred eighty-eight patients had paired scans (mean interval 10.9 months). Antibody responders (n = 45) had greater brain volume decrease (3.12 ± 1.98 vs 2.04 ± 1.74%; p = 0.007), greater ventricular enlargement as a percentage of baseline brain volume (1.10 ± 0.75 vs 0.48 ± 0.40%; p < 0.001), and a nonsignificant greater hippocampal volume decrease (3.78 ± 2.63 vs 2.86 ± 3.19%; p = 0.124) than placebo patients (n = 57). Increased losses in brain volume were not reflected in worsening cognitive performance; a composite z score across a Neuropsychological Test Battery showed differences favoring antibody responders over placebo (0.03 ± 0.39 vs -0.24 ± 0.45; p = 0.008). Conclusions: A dissociation between brain volume loss and cognitive function was observed in AN1792/QS-21 antibody responders. The reasons for this remain unclear but include the possibility that volume changes were due to amyloid removal and associated cerebral fluid shifts.

Another common subtype of dementia like AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is determined by the disappearance of dopaminergic neurons in the region known as substantia nigra pars compacta located in the midbrain. Both AD and PD target aged population worldwide forming a major chunk of healthcare costs. Hence, there is a need for methods that help in the early diagnosis of these diseases. PD subjects especially those who have confirmed postmortem plaque are a strong candidate for a second AD diagnosis. Modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can be combined with deep learning methods to diagnose these two diseases for the benefit of clinicians. Result: In this work, we deployed a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features for multiclass classification of both AD and PD in the frequency and spatial domains using PET and SPECT neuroimaging modalities to differentiate between AD, PD and Normal Control (NC) classes. Discrete Cosine Transform has been deployed as a frequency domain learning method along with random weak Gaussian blurring and random zooming in/out augmentation methods in both frequency and spatial domains. To select the hyperparameters of the 3D-CNN model, we deployed both 5- and 10-fold cross-validation (CV) approaches. The best performing model was found to be AD/NC(SPECT)/PD classification with random weak Gaussian blurred augmentation in the spatial domain using fivefold CV approach while the worst performing model happens to be AD/NC(PET)/PD classification without augmentation in the frequency domain using tenfold CV approach. We also found that spatial domain methods tend to perform better than their frequency domain counterparts. Conclusion: The proposed model provides a good performance in discriminating AD and PD subjects due to minimal correlation between these two dementia types on the clinicopathological continuum between AD and PD subjects from a neuroimaging perspective.",0.56363,0.568467,0.5851988,0.6303838,0.5884707,0.54716724,0.55277985,0.5504741,0.56484115,0.6045076,0.6276792,0.61093545,0.6067495,0.57541794,3D convolutional neural networks-based multiclass classification of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases using PET and SPECT neuroimaging modalities,12/1/2021,,Ahsan Bin Tufail; Yong Kui Ma; Qiu Na Zhang; Adil Khan; Lei Zhao; Qiang Yang; Muhammad Adeel; Rahim Khan; Inam Ullah,Brain Informatics,22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118544738&origin=inward,,,,,2021,"@article{,

Hippocampus is one of the involved regions and its atrophy is a widely used biomarker for AD diagnosis. We have recently developed DenseCNN, a lightweight 3D deep convolutional network model, for AD classification based on hippocampus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segments. In addition to the visual features of the hippocampus segments, the global shape representations of the hippocampus are also important for AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose DenseCNN2, a deep convolutional network model for AD classification by incorporating global shape representations along with hippocampus segmentations. Methods: The data was obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and was T1-weighted structural MRI from initial screening or baseline, including ADNI 1,2/GO and 3. DenseCNN2 was trained and evaluated with 326 AD subjects and 607 CN hippocampus MRI using 5-fold cross-validation strategy. DenseCNN2 was compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for the task of AD classification. Results: We showed that DenseCNN2 with combined visual and global shape features performed better than deep learning models with visual or global shape features alone. DenseCNN2 achieved an average accuracy of 0.925, sensitivity of 0.882, specificity of 0.949, and area under curve (AUC) of 0.978, which are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods in AD classification.

Many clinical trials of potential therapies for AD have failed, and there is currently no approved disease-modifying treatment. Biomarkers for early detection and mechanistic understanding of disease course are critical for drug development and clinical trials. Amyloid has been the focus of most biomarker research. Here, we developed a deep learning-based framework to identify informative features for AD classification using tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Results: The 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classification model of AD from cognitively normal (CN) yielded an average accuracy of 90.8% based on five-fold cross-validation. The LRP model identified the brain regions in tau PET images that contributed most to the AD classification from CN. The top identified regions included the hippocampus, parahippocampus, thalamus, and fusiform. The layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) results were consistent with those from the voxel-wise analysis in SPM12, showing significant focal AD associated regional tau deposition in the bilateral temporal lobes including the entorhinal cortex. The AD probability scores calculated by the classifier were correlated with brain tau deposition in the medial temporal lobe in MCI participants (r = 0.43 for early MCI and r = 0.49 for late MCI). Conclusion: A deep learning framework combining 3D CNN and LRP algorithms can be used with tau PET images to identify informative features for AD classification and may have application for early detection during prodromal stages of AD.",0.5442014,0.5302037,0.55104893,0.5730737,0.5746169,0.529503,0.535726,0.5207678,0.53848696,0.56604505,0.5952481,0.5595192,0.5992674,0.54708004,Deep learning detection of informative features in tau PET for Alzheimer’s disease classification,12/1/2020,,Taeho Jo; Kwangsik Nho; Shannon L.

Al-though tests such as the Mini-Mental State Tests Examination are usually used for early identification, diagnosis relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain analysis. Methods: Public initiatives such as the OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies) collection provide neuroimaging datasets openly available for research purposes. In this work, a new method based on deep learning and image processing techniques for MRI-based Alzheimer’s diagnosis is proposed and compared with previous literature works. Results: Our method achieves a balance accuracy (BAC) up to 0.93 for image-based automated diagnosis of the disease, and a BAC of 0.88 for the establishment of the disease stage (healthy tissue, very mild and severe stage). Conclusions: Results obtained surpassed the state-of-the-art proposals using the OASIS collection. This demonstrates that deep learning-based strategies are an effective tool for building a robust solution for Alzheimer’s-assisted diagnosis based on MRI data.",0.52991927,0.5857578,0.55799705,0.59469944,0.5865866,0.56331563,0.52534574,0.5175466,0.5381424,0.5603968,0.6282052,0.5731408,0.5795959,0.61776006,Mri deep learning-based solution for alzheimer’s disease prediction,9/1/2021,,Cristina L.

Accurate diagnosis of AD is significant, especially its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), for timely therapy is possibly beneficial to delay the disease progression. Some existing studies indicated that different biomarkers provide complementary information to discriminate MCI patients from healthy normal controls (NCs), but the high complexity of these algorithms brought high computational cost. Objective: To identify Alzheimer's disease in its early stage with a low computational complexity where the complementary of different biomarkers can still be used. Method: In this work, we employ the methodology of ensemble learning to construct a two-stage classifier for combining the classification capacity of three biomarkers, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and quantification of specific proteins measured through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), to identify MCIs from healthy controls based on support vector machines algorithm. In the first stage, two SVM classifiers based on MRI and CSF are used for the identification of MCI, respectively. For the samples which can get the same results in the first stage will be seen as the training data, and the ones with the inconsistent result will be put into the second stage as the test data, where PET features are adapted to the classification. Results: An original dataset downloaded from ADNI database, where 99 MCI patients and 52 healthy controls included, had been adopted for the validation of our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the two-stage ensemble classifier with a classification accuracy of 75.5%, a sensitivity of 78.4% and a specificity of 70.0%. Conclusion: This study proposed a computational framework to identify the early stage of AD by a two-stage ensemble strategy. The performance of this work shows that combination of different biomarkers can improve identification of MCI with a relatively low computational cost, which is very meaningful for the diagnosis and delay of the AD progress.",0.49134567,0.6410762,0.61839956,0.6112805,0.5259923,0.5126997,0.481118,0.47587478,0.5432509,0.54654676,0.54358613,0.5013885,0.54744774,0.56242365,Early stage identification of Alzheimer’s disease using a two-stage ensemble classifier,1/1/2018,,Bing Wang; Kun Lu; Xiao Zheng; Benyue Su; Yuming Zhou; Peng Chen; Jun Zhang,Current Bioinformatics,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053125597&origin=inward,,,,529-535,2018,"@article{,

Treatments following early AD detection can significantly delay institutionalisation and extend patients' independence. There has been a growing focus on early AD detection using artificial intelligence. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven revolutionary for image-based applications and have been applied to brain scans. In recent years, studies have utilised two-dimensional (2D) CNNs on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for AD detection. To apply a 2D CNN on three-dimensional (3D) MRI volumes, each MRI scan is split into 2D image slices. A CNN is trained over the image slices by calculating a loss function between each subject's label and each image slice's predicted output. Although 2D CNNs can discover spatial dependencies in an image slice, they cannot understand the temporal dependencies among 2D image slices in a 3D MRI volume. This study aims to resolve this issue by modelling the sequence of MRI features produced by a CNN with deep sequence-based networks for AD detection. Method: The CNN utilised in this paper was ResNet-18 pre-trained on an ImageNet dataset. The employed sequence-based models were the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and different types of recurrent neural networks. Several deep sequence-based models and configurations were implemented and compared for AD detection. Results: Our proposed TCN model achieved the best classification performance with 91.78% accuracy, 91.56% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Conclusion: Our results show that applying sequence-based models can improve the classification accuracy of 2D and 3D CNNs for AD detection by up to 10%.",0.50000185,0.5149147,0.5377165,0.5349954,0.55074346,0.54219985,0.5133443,0.50426227,0.5389227,0.5572507,0.60517097,0.53093225,0.6308618,0.5561362,Deep sequence modelling for Alzheimer's disease detection using MRI,7/1/2021,,Amir Ebrahimi; Suhuai Luo; Raymond Chiong,Computers in Biology and Medicine,50,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85108179033&origin=inward,,,,,2021,"@article{,

Therefore, many researches have been presented about AD detection and cure. In addition, machine learning models have also been proposed to detect AD promptly. Materials and method: In this work, a new brain image dataset was collected. This dataset contains two categories, and these categories are healthy and AD. This dataset was collected from 1070 subjects. This work presents an automatic AD detection model to detect AD using brain images automatically. The presented model is called a feed-forward local phase quantization network (LPQNet). LPQNet consists of (i) multilevel feature generation based on LPQ and average pooling, (ii) feature selection using neighborhood component analysis (NCA), and (iii) classification phases. The prime objective of the presented LPQNet is to reach high accuracy with low computational complexity. LPQNet generates features on six levels. Therefore, 256 × 6 = 1536 features are generated from an image, and the most important 256 out 1536 features are selected. The selected 256 features are classified on the conventional classifiers to denote the classification capability of the generated and selected features by LPQNet. Results: The presented LPQNet was tested on three image datasets to demonstrate the universal classification ability of the LPQNet. The proposed LPQNet attained 99.68%, 100%, and 99.64% classification accuracy on the collected AD image dataset, the Harvard Brain Atlas AD dataset, and the Kaggle AD dataset. Moreover, LPQNet attained 99.62% accuracy on the Kaggle AD dataset using four classes. Conclusions: Moreover, the calculated results from LPQNet are compared to other automatic AD detection models. Comparisons, results, and findings clearly denote the superiority of the presented model. In addition, a new intelligent AD detector application can be developed for use in magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) devices. By using the developed automated AD detector, new generation intelligence MR and CT devices can be developed.",0.47178906,0.51078963,0.50488573,0.48975375,0.5359248,0.51549,0.47715738,0.46800068,0.50172704,0.53474945,0.5482576,0.490383,0.54201716,0.57608646,Feed-forward LPQNet based Automatic Alzheimer's Disease Detection Model,10/1/2021,,Ela Kaplan; Sengul Dogan; Turker Tuncer; Mehmet Baygin; Erman Altunisik,Computers in Biology and Medicine,22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114801673&origin=inward,,,,,2021,"@article{,

Its causes are not yet fully understood, and there is no curative treatment. However, neuroimaging tools currently offer help in clinical diagnosis, and, recently, deep learning methods have rapidly become a key methodology applied to these tools. The reason is that they require little or no image preprocessing and can automatically infer an optimal representation of the data from raw images without requiring prior feature selection, resulting in a more objective and less biased process. However, training a reliable model is challenging due to the significant differences in brain image types. Methods: We aim to contribute to the research and study of Alzheimer's disease through computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) by comparing different deep learning models. In this work, there are three main objectives: i) to present a fully automated deep-ensemble approach for dementia-level classification from brain images, ii) to compare different deep learning architectures to obtain the most suitable one for the task, and (iii) evaluate the robustness of the proposed strategy in a deep learning framework to detect Alzheimer's disease and recognise different levels of dementia. The proposed approach is specifically designed to be potential support for clinical care based on patients' brain images. Results: Our strategy was developed and tested on three MRI and one fMRI public datasets with heterogeneous characteristics. By performing a comprehensive analysis of binary classification (Alzheimer's disease status or not) and multiclass classification (recognising different levels of dementia), the proposed approach can exceed state of the art in both tasks, reaching an accuracy of 98.51% in the binary case, and 98.67% in the multiclass case averaged over the four different data sets. Conclusion: We strongly believe that integrating the proposed deep-ensemble approach will result in robust and reliable CAD systems, considering the numerous cross-dataset experiments performed. Being tested on MRIs and fMRIs, our strategy can be easily extended to other imaging techniques. In conclusion, we found that our deep-ensemble strategy could be efficiently applied for this task with a considerable potential benefit for patient management.",0.56841743,0.67170584,0.6298879,0.6227341,0.6302209,0.59017146,0.5679065,0.55313385,0.5865408,0.6224919,0.6629935,0.60504365,0.6330827,0.6336442,Deep learning based pipelines for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: A comparative study and a novel deep-ensemble method,2/1/2022,,Andrea Loddo; Sara Buttau; Cecilia Di Ruberto,Computers in Biology and Medicine,57,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119922422&origin=inward,,,,,2022,"@article{,

This research addresses an Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA) in combination with LR for identifying the best biomarker combination for prediction of the progression to AD. Results: The model has been explored in terms of parameter optimization to predict conversion from healthy stage to AD with high accuracy. Several feature sets were selected - the resulting prediction moddels showed higher area under the ROC values (0.83-0.89). The results has shown consistency with some of the medical research reported in literature.

Advances in medical imaging and computational power enable new methods for the early detection of neurocognitive disorders with the goal of preventing or reducing cognitive decline. Computer-aided image analysis and early detection of changes in cognition is a promising approach for patients with mild cognitive impairment, sometimes a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Methods: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines of studies where machine learning was applied to neuroimaging data in order to predict whether patients with mild cognitive impairment might develop Alzheimer’s disease dementia or remain stable. After removing duplicates, we screened 452 studies and selected 116 for qualitative analysis. Results: Most studies used magnetic resonance image (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data but also magnetoencephalography. The datasets were mainly extracted from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database with some exceptions. Regarding the algorithms used, the most common was support vector machine with a mean accuracy of 75.4%, but convolutional neural networks achieved a higher mean accuracy of 78.5%. Studies combining MRI and PET achieved overall better classification accuracy than studies that only used one neuroimaging technique. In general, the more complex models such as those based on deep learning, combined with multimodal and multidimensional data (neuroimaging, clinical, cognitive, genetic, and behavioral) achieved the best performance. Conclusions: Although the performance of the different methods still has room for improvement, the results are promising and this methodology has a great potential as a support tool for clinicians and healthcare professionals.",0.51513577,0.5886762,0.5671162,0.6377377,0.56412137,0.55854416,0.50974494,0.4964646,0.5268169,0.55399054,0.60327,0.5503294,0.56848055,0.56727254,Machine learning methods for predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease dementia: a systematic review,12/1/2021,,Sergio Grueso; Raquel Viejo-Sobera,Alzheimer's Research and Therapy,78,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85115824082&origin=inward,,,,,2021,"@article{,

The aim of this study is to study the concurrent validity of the HarP toward local protocols, and its major sources of variance. Methods: Fourteen tracers segmented 10 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cases scanned at 1.5 T and 3T following local protocols, qualified for segmentation based on the HarP through a standard web-platform and resegmented following the HarP. The five most accurate tracers followed the HarP to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at three time points on both 1.5 T and 3T. Results: The agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local protocols (absolute left/right ICC 0.44/0.43) and much higher with the HarP (absolute left/right ICC 0.88/0.89). On the larger set of 15 cases, the HarP agreement within (left/right ICC range: 0.94/0.95 to 0.99/0.99) and among tracers (left/right ICC range: 0.89/0.90) was very high. The volume variance due to different tracers was 0.9% of the total, comparing favorably to variance due to scanner manufacturer (1.2), atrophy rates (3.5), hemispheric asymmetry (3.7), field strength (4.4), and significantly smaller than the variance due to atrophy (33.5%, P <.001), and physiological variability (49.2%, P <.001).

One solution is to train DL models using healthy subjects' data which are more widely available and transfer them to patients' data. Purpose: To evaluate the transferability of a DL-based ASL MRI denoising method (DLASL). Study Type: Retrospective. Subjects: Four hundred and twenty-eight subjects (189 females) from three cohorts. Field Strength/Sequence: 3 T two-dimensional (2D) echo-planar imaging (EPI)-based pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) and 2D EPI-based pulsed ASL (PASL) sequences. Assessment: DLASL was trained using young healthy adults' PCASL data (Dataset 1: 250/30 subjects as training/validation set) and was directly transferred (DTF) to PCASL data from Dataset 2 (45 subjects test set) of normal controls (NC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups. DLASL was fine-tuned (DLASLFT) and tested on PASL data from Dataset 3 (103 subjects test set) of NC and AD. An existing non-DL method (NonDL) was used for comparison. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) images from ASL MRI were compared between NC and AD to assess characteristic hypoperfusion (lower CBF) patterns in AD. CBF image quality and CBF map sensitivity for detecting hypoperfusion using peak t-value and suprathreshold cluster size are outcome measures. Statistical Tests: Paired t-test, two-sample t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and Tukey honestly significant difference, and linear mixed-effects models were used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Mean contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of Dataset 2 showed that DTF outperformed NonDL (AD: 3.38 vs. 2.64, NC: 3.80 vs. 3.36). On Dataset 3, DLASLFT outperformed NonDL measured by mean CNR (AD: 2.45 vs. 1.87, NC: 2.54 vs. 2.17) and mean radiologic score (2.86 vs. 2.44). Image quality improvement was significant on both test sets. DTF and DLASLFT improved sensitivity for detecting AD-related hypoperfusion patterns compared with NonDL. Data Conclusion: We demonstrated the DLASL's transferability across different ASL sequences and different populations. Level of Evidence: 3.

Thus, early identification of which subjects at high risk, e.g., with MCI, will later develop AD is of key importance. Currently available machine learning algorithms achieve only limited predictive accuracy or they are based on expensive and hard-to-collect information. Objective: The current study aims to develop an algorithm for a 3-year prediction of conversion to AD in MCI and PreMCI subjects based only on non-invasively and effectively collectable predictors. Methods: A dataset of 123 MCI/PreMCI subjects was used to train different machine learning techniques. Baseline information regarding sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and neuropsychological test scores, cardiovascular risk indexes, and a visual rating scale for brain atrophy was used to extract 36 predictors. Leave-pair-out-cross-validation was employed as validation strategy and a recursive feature elimination procedure was applied to identify a relevant subset of predictors. Results: 16 predictors were selected from all domains excluding sociodemographic information. The best model resulted a support vector machine with radial-basis function kernel (whole sample: AUC= 0.962, best balanced accuracy = 0.913; MCI sub-group alone: AUC= 0.914, best balanced accuracy = 0.874). Conclusions: Our algorithm shows very high cross-validated performances that outperform the vast majority of the currently available algorithms, and all those which use only non-invasive and effectively assessable predictors.

2035,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2020.108795,3.92E-05,5,3,"Background: Compared with single-modal neuroimages classification of AD, multi-modal classification can achieve better performance by fusing different information. Exploring synergy among various multi-modal neuroimages is contributed to identifying the pathological process of neurological disorders. However, it is still problematic to effectively exploit multi-modal information since the lack of an effective fusion method. New method: In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal fusion network based on the attention mechanism, which can selectively extract features from MRI and PET branches and suppress irrelevant information. In the attention model, the fusion ratio of each modality is assigned automatically according to the importance of the data. A hierarchical fusion method is adopted to ensure the effectiveness of Multi-modal Fusion. Results: Evaluating the model on the ADNI dataset, the experimental results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, the final classification results of the NC/AD, SMCI/PMCI and Four-Class are 95.21 %, 89.79 %, and 86.15 %, respectively. Comparison with existing methods: : Different from the early fusion and the late fusion, the hierarchical fusion method contributes to learning the synergy between the multi-modal data. Compared with some other prominent algorithms, the attention model enables our network to focus on the regions of interest and effectively fuse the multi-modal data. Conclusion: Benefit from the hierarchical structure with attention model, the proposed network is capable of exploiting low-level and high-level features extracted from the multi-modal data and improving the accuracy of AD diagnosis.

Objective: Inspired from the eigenface approach for face recognition problems, we proposed an eigenbrain to detect AD brains. Eigenface is only for 2D image processing and is not suitable for volumetric image processing since faces are usually obtained as 2D images. Methods: We extended the eigenbrain to 3D. This 3D eigenbrain (3D-EB) inherits the fundamental strategies in either eigenface or 2D eigenbrain (2D-EB). All the 3D brains were transferred to a feature space, which encoded the variation among known 3D brain images. The feature space was named as the 3D-EB, and defined as eigenvectors on the set of 3D brains. We compared four different classifiers: feed-forward neural network, support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel, polynomial (Pol) kernel, and radial basis function kernel. Results: The 50x10-fold stratified cross validation experiments showed that the proposed 3D-EB is better than the 2DEB. SVM with Pol kernel performed the best among all classifiers. Our ""3D-EB + Pol-SVM"" achieved an accuracy of 92.81%±1.99%, a sensitivity of 92.07%±2.48%, a specificity of 93.02%±2.22%, and a precision of 79.03%±2.37%.

Neuropsychological testing is a key element in the diagnostic procedures of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), but has presently a limited value in the prediction of progression to dementia. We advance the hypothesis that newer statistical classification methods derived from data mining and machine learning methods like Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests can improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of predictions obtained from neuropsychological testing. Seven non parametric classifiers derived from data mining methods (Multilayer Perceptrons Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, CART, CHAID and QUEST Classification Trees and Random Forests) were compared to three traditional classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression) in terms of overall classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, Area under the ROC curve and Press'Q. Model predictors were 10 neuropsychological tests currently used in the diagnosis of dementia. Statistical distributions of classification parameters obtained from a 5-fold cross-validation were compared using the Friedman's nonparametric test. Results: Press' Q test showed that all classifiers performed better than chance alone (p < 0.05). Support Vector Machines showed the larger overall classification accuracy (Median (Me) = 0.76) an area under the ROC (Me = 0.90). However this method showed high specificity (Me = 1.0) but low sensitivity (Me = 0.3). Random Forest ranked second in overall accuracy (Me = 0.73) with high area under the ROC (Me = 0.73) specificity (Me = 0.73) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). Linear Discriminant Analysis also showed acceptable overall accuracy (Me = 0.66), with acceptable area under the ROC (Me = 0.72) specificity (Me = 0.66) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). The remaining classifiers showed overall classification accuracy above a median value of 0.63, but for most sensitivity was around or even lower than a median value of 0.5. Conclusions: When taking into account sensitivity, specificity and overall classification accuracy Random Forests and Linear Discriminant analysis rank first among all the classifiers tested in prediction of dementia using several neuropsychological tests. These methods may be used to improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of Dementia predictions from neuropsychological testing. © 2011Maroco et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0.47359523,0.5630657,0.5745587,0.48449475,0.50778204,0.46781683,0.48283854,0.47126672,0.5588657,0.5003712,0.5481793,0.47273308,0.5144184,0.5741537,"Data mining methods in the prediction of Dementia: A real-data comparison of the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and random forests",10/4/2011,,João Maroco; Dina Silva; Ana Rodrigues; Manuela Guerreiro; Isabel Santana; Alexandre De Mendonça,BMC Research Notes,309,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80051660823&origin=inward,,,,,2011,"@article{,

There are many existing studies on the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on MRI data. However, there are no studies on the transfer learning between different datasets (including different subjects), thereby improving the sample size of target dataset indirectly. Methods: Therefore, a new framework method is proposed in this paper to solve this problem. First, gravity transfer is used to transfer the source domain data closer to the target data set. Secondly, the best deviation between the transferred source domain samples and the target domain samples is searched by instance transfer learning algorithm (ITL) based on wrapper mode, thereby obtaining optimal transferred domain samples. Finally, the optimal transferred domain samples and the target domain training samples are combined for classification. If the source data and the target data have different features, a feature growing algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Results: The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective regardless of different kernel functions, different number of samples and different parameters. Besides, the transferred source domain samples by ITL algorithm can enlarge the target domain training samples and assist to improve the classification accuracy significantly. Conclusions: Therefore, the study can enlarge the samples of AD by instance transfer learning, thereby being helpful for the small sample problems of AD.

Machine learning (ML) approaches have been extensively used in attempts to develop algorithms for reliable early diagnosis of AD, although clinical usefulness, interpretability, and generalizability of the classifiers across datasets and MRI protocols remain limited. Methods: We report a multi-diagnostic and generalizable approach for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD diagnosis using structural MRI and ML. Classifiers were trained and tested using subjects from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (n = 570) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) project database (n = 531). Several classifiers are compared and combined using voting for a decision. Additionally, we report tests of generalizability across datasets and protocols (IR-SPGR and MPRAGE), the impact of using graph theory measures on diagnostic classification performance, the relative importance of different brain regions on classification for better interpretability, and an evaluation of the potential for clinical applicability of the classifier. Results: Our “healthy controls (HC) vs. AD” classifier trained and tested on the combination of ADNI and OASIS datasets obtained a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 90.6% and a Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.811. Our “HC vs. MCI vs. AD” classifier trained and tested on the ADNI dataset obtained a 62.1% BAC (33.3% being the by-chance cut-off) and 0.438 MCC. Hippocampal features were the strongest contributors to the classification decisions (approx. 25–45%), followed by temporal (approx. 13%), cingulate, and frontal regions (approx. 8–13% each), which is consistent with our current understanding of AD and its progression. Classifiers generalized well across both datasets and protocols. Finally, using graph theory measures did not improve classification performance. Conclusions: In sum, we present a diagnostic tool for MCI and AD trained using baseline scans and a follow-up diagnosis regardless of progression, which is multi-diagnostic, generalizable across independent data sources and acquisition protocols, and with transparently reported performance.

Moreover, we compare this approach with a novel classification strategy based on fuzzy logic learned on a mixed cohort including only HC and AD. Experiments: A training set of 240 subjects and a test set including mixed cohort of 500 real and simulated subjects were used.

Machine learning (ML) is suitable to improve early AD prediction. The etiology of AD is heterogeneous, which leads to high variability in disease patterns. Further variability originates from multicentric study designs, varying acquisition protocols, and errors in the preprocessing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The high variability makes the differentiation between signal and noise difficult and may lead to overfitting. This article examines whether an automatic and fair data valuation method based on Shapley values can identify the most informative subjects to improve ML classification. Methods: An ML workflow was developed and trained for a subset of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The validation was executed for an independent ADNI test set and for the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) cohort. The workflow included volumetric MRI feature extraction, feature selection, sample selection using Data Shapley, random forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for model training as well as Kernel SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for model interpretation. Results: The RF models, which excluded 134 of the 467 training subjects based on their RF Data Shapley values, outperformed the base models that reached a mean accuracy of 62.64% by 5.76% (3.61 percentage points) for the independent ADNI test set. The XGBoost base models reached a mean accuracy of 60.00% for the AIBL data set. The exclusion of those 133 subjects with the smallest RF Data Shapley values could improve the classification accuracy by 2.98% (1.79 percentage points). The cutoff values were calculated using an independent validation set. Conclusion: The Data Shapley method was able to improve the mean accuracies for the test sets.

We evaluated if a modified GAN can learn from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of multiple magnetic field strengths to enhance Alzheimer’s disease (AD) classification performance. Methods: T1-weighted brain MRI scans from 151 participants of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), who underwent both 1.5-Tesla (1.5-T) and 3-Tesla imaging at the same time were selected to construct a GAN model. This model was trained along with a three-dimensional fully convolutional network (FCN) using the generated images (3T*) as inputs to predict AD status. Quality of the generated images was evaluated using signal to noise ratio (SNR), Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) and Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE). Cases from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL, n = 107) and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC, n = 565) were used for model validation. Results: The 3T*-based FCN classifier performed better than the FCN model trained using the 1.5-T scans.

In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the classification framework, which combines structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) metrics, to distinguish mild cognitive impairment non-converters (MCInc)/AD from MCI converters (MCIc) by using graph theory and machine learning. Methods: With the intra-subject (MCInc vs. MCIc) and inter-subject (MCIc vs. AD) design, we employed cortical thickness features, structural brain network features, and sub-frequency (full-band, slow-4, slow-5) functional brain network features for classification. Three feature selection methods [random subset feature selection algorithm (RSFS), minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR), and sparse linear regression feature selection algorithm based on stationary selection (SS-LR)] were used respectively to select discriminative features in the iterative combinations of MRI and network measures. Then support vector machine (SVM) classifier with nested cross-validation was employed for classification. We also compared the performance of multiple classifiers (Random Forest, K-nearest neighbor, Adaboost, SVM) and verified the reliability of our results by upsampling. Results: We found that in the classifications of MCIc vs. MCInc, and MCIc vs. AD, the proposed RSFS algorithm achieved the best accuracies (84.71, 89.80%) than the other algorithms. And the high-sensitivity brain regions found with the two classification groups were inconsistent. Specifically, in MCIc vs. MCInc, the high-sensitivity brain regions associated with both structural and functional features included frontal, temporal, caudate, entorhinal, parahippocampal, and calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex. While in MCIc vs. AD, the high-sensitivity brain regions associated only with functional features included frontal, temporal, thalamus, olfactory, and angular. Conclusions: These results suggest that our proposed method could effectively predict the conversion of MCI to AD, and the inconsistency of specific brain regions provides a novel insight for clinical AD diagnosis.",0.52375126,0.5389262,0.57532746,0.54154986,0.5238983,0.45163006,0.49718806,0.47955883,0.56245387,0.53875345,0.5279858,0.49322012,0.5586216,0.55758,Predicting MCI to AD Conversation Using Integrated sMRI and rs-fMRI: Machine Learning and Graph Theory Approach,7/30/2021,,Tingting Zhang; Qian Liao; Danmei Zhang; Chao Zhang; Jing Yan; Ronald Ngetich; Junjun Zhang; Zhenlan Jin; Ling Li,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85113166611&origin=inward,,,,,2021,"@article{,

Hippocampal atrophy can be evaluated in terms of hippocampal volumes and shapes using structural MR images. However, the shape and volume features from hippocampus mask have limited discriminative information for AD diagnosis. In addition, extraction of these features is independent of classification model, resulting to sub-optimal performance for disease diagnosis. New method: This paper proposes a hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network for more detailed hippocampus analysis using structural MR images in AD. The DenseNets are constructed on the decomposed image patches of internal and external hippocampus to learn the intensity and shape features. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is cascaded to combine the features from the left and right hippocampus and learn the high-level features for disease classification. Results: Our proposed method is evaluated with the baseline MR images of 807 subjects including 194 AD, 397 MCI and 216 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experiments show the proposed method achieves AUC (area under ROC curve) of 91.0%, 75.8% and 74.6% for classifications of AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI, respectively.

However, there has been no study attempting to simultaneously discriminate among Healthy Controls (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI (cMCI) and stable AD, using features derived from a single modality, namely MRI. New method: Based on preprocessed MRI images from the organizers of a neuroimaging challenge, 3 we attempted to quantify the prediction accuracy of multiple morphological MRI features to simultaneously discriminate among HC, MCI, cMCI and AD. We explored the efficacy of a novel scheme that includes multiple feature selections via Random Forest from subsets of the whole set of features (e.g. whole set, left/right hemisphere etc.), Random Forest classification using a fusion approach and ensemble classification via majority voting. From the ADNI database, 60 HC, 60 MCI, 60 cMCI and 60 CE were used as a training set with known labels. An extra dataset of 160 subjects (HC: 40, MCI: 40, cMCI: 40 and AD: 40) was used as an external blind validation dataset to evaluate the proposed machine learning scheme. Results: In the second blind dataset, we succeeded in a four-class classification of 61.9% by combining MRI-based features with a Random Forest-based Ensemble Strategy. We achieved the best classification accuracy of all teams that participated in this neuroimaging competition. Comparison with existing method(s): The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to simultaneously discriminate among four groups using morphological MRI features for the very first time in the literature.

Methods: The datasets used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To segment the hippocampal region automatically, the patient brain MR images were matched to the International Consortium for Brain Mapping template (ICBM) using 3D-Slicer software. Using prior knowledge and anatomical annotation label information, the hippocampal region was automatically extracted from the brain MR images. Results: The area of the hippocampus in each image was preprocessed using local entropy mini-mization with a bi-cubic spline model (LEMS) by an inhomogeneity intensity correction method. To train the CNN model, we separated the dataset into three groups, namely AD/NC, AD/MCI, and MCI/NC. The prediction model achieved an accuracy of 92.3% for AD/NC, 85.6% for AD/MCI, and 78.1% for MCI/NC.

However, lack of accessibility and neurobiological correlation are the main obstacles to their clinical application. Machine learning algorithms can effectively identify personalized biomarkers based on the prominent symptoms of AD. Methods: Episodic memory–related magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of 143 patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were identified using a multivariate relevance vector regression algorithm. The support vector machine classification model was constructed using these MRI features and verified in 2 independent datasets (N = 994). The neurobiological basis was also investigated based on cognitive assessments, neuropathologic biomarkers of cerebrospinal fluid, and positron emission tomography images of amyloid-β plaques. Results: The combination of gray matter volume and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation MRI features accurately predicted episodic memory impairment in individual patients with amnesic MCI (r = 0.638) when measured using an episodic memory assessment panel. The MRI features that contributed to episodic memory prediction were primarily distributed across the default mode network and limbic network. The classification model based on these features distinguished patients with AD from normal control subjects with more than 86% accuracy. Furthermore, most identified episodic memory–related regions showed significantly different amyloid-β positron emission tomography measurements among the AD, MCI, and normal control groups. Moreover, the classification outputs significantly correlated with cognitive assessment scores and cerebrospinal fluid pathological biomarkers' levels in the MCI and AD groups.

In this study, we developed a multivariate prognostic model for predicting MCI-to-dementia progression at the individual patient level. Methods: Using baseline data from 259 MCI patients and a probabilistic, kernel-based pattern classification approach, we trained a classifier to distinguish between patients who progressed to AD-type dementia (n = 139) and those who did not (n = 120) during a three-year follow-up period. More than 750 variables across four data sources were considered as potential predictors of progression. These data sources included risk factors, cognitive and functional assessments, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and plasma proteomic data. Predictive utility was assessed using a rigorous cross-validation framework. Results: Cognitive and functional markers were most predictive of progression, while plasma proteomic markers had limited predictive utility. The best performing model incorporated a combination of cognitive/functional markers and morphometric MRI measures and predicted progression with 80% accuracy (83% sensitivity, 76% specificity, AUC = 0.87). Predictors of progression included scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Functional Activities Questionnaire, as well as volume/cortical thickness of three brain regions (left hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior parietal cortex). Calibration analysis revealed that the model is capable of generating probabilistic predictions that reliably reflect the actual risk of progression. Finally, we found that the predictive accuracy of the model varied with patient demographic, genetic, and clinical characteristics and could be further improved by taking into account the confidence of the predictions. Conclusions: We developed an accurate prognostic model for predicting MCI-to-dementia progression over a three-year period.

There is active research aimed at identifying automated methodologies able to extract accurate classification indexes from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Such indexes should be fit for identifying AD patients as early as possible. Subjects: A reference group composed of 144. AD patients and 189 age-matched controls was used to train and test the procedure. It was then applied on a study group composed of 302 MCI subjects, 136 having progressed to clinically probable AD (MCI-converters) and 166 having remained stable or recovered to normal condition after a 24. month follow-up (MCI-non converters). All subjects came from the ADNI database. Methods: We sampled the brain with 7 relatively small volumes, mainly centered on the MTL, and 2 control regions. These volumes were filtered to give intensity and textural MRI-based features. Each filtered region was analyzed with a Random Forest (RF) classifier to extract relevant features, which were subsequently processed with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Once a prediction model was trained and tested on the reference group, it was used to compute a classification index (CI) on the MCI cohort and to assess its accuracy in predicting AD conversion in MCI patients. The performance of the classification based on the features extracted by the whole 9 volumes is compared with that derived from each single volume. All experiments were performed using a bootstrap sampling estimation, and classifier performance was cross-validated with a 20-fold paradigm. Results: We identified a restricted set of image features correlated with the conversion to AD. It is shown that most information originate from a small subset of the total available features, and that it is enough to give a reliable assessment. We found multiple, highly localized image-based features which alone are responsible for the overall clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The classification index is able to discriminate Controls from AD with an Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.97 (sensitivity ≃ 89% at specificity ≃ 94%) and Controls from MCI-converters with an AUC = 0.92 (sensitivity ≃ 89% at specificity ≃ 80%). MCI-converters are separated from MCI-non converters with AUC = 0.74(sensitivity ≃ 72% at specificity ≃ 65%). Findings: The present automated MRI-based technique revealed a strong relationship between highly localized baseline-MRI features and the baseline clinical assessment. In addition, the classification index was also used to predict the probability of AD conversion within a time frame of two years. The definition of a single index combining local analysis of several regions can be useful to detect AD neurodegeneration in a typical MCI population. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0.52082664,0.53659916,0.54479843,0.5285974,0.5241412,0.46634305,0.4804548,0.47159022,0.53085774,0.52509207,0.5144971,0.48322982,0.5167535,0.59083855,Local MRI analysis approach in the diagnosis of early and prodromal Alzheimer's disease,9/15/2011,,Andrea Chincarini; Paolo Bosco; Piero Calvini; Gianluca Gemme; Mario Esposito; Chiara Olivieri; Luca Rei; Sandro Squarcia; Guido Rodriguez; Roberto Bellotti; Piergiorgio Cerello; Ivan De Mitri; Alessandra Retico; Flavio Nobili,NeuroImage,161,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80051784240&origin=inward,,,,469-480,2011,"@article{,

It is extremely important to develop criteria that can be used to separate the MCI subjects at imminent risk of conversion to Alzheimer-type dementia from those who would remain stable. We have developed an automatic algorithm for computing a novel measure of hippocampal volumetric integrity (HVI) from structural MRI scans that may be useful for this purpose. Objective: To determine the utility of HVI in classification between stable and progressive MCI patients using the Random Forest classification algorithm. Methods: We used a 16-dimensional feature space including bilateral HVI obtained from baseline and one-year follow-up structural MRI, cognitive tests, and genetic and demographic information to train a Random Forest classifier in a sample of 164 MCI subjects categorized into two groups [progressive (n=86) or stable (n=78)] based on future conversion (or lack thereof) of their diagnosis to probable AD. Results: The overall accuracy of classification was estimated to be 82.3 (86.0 sensitivity, 78.2 specificity). The accuracy in women (89.1) was considerably higher than that in men (78.9). The prediction accuracy achieved in women is the highest reported in any previous application of machine learning to AD diagnosis in MCI. Conclusion: The method presented in this paper can be used to separate stable MCI patients from those who are at early stages of AD dementia with high accuracy.

Objective: To determine whether MCI represents early-stage AD by examining its natural history and neuropathologic basis. Design: A prospective clinical and psychometric study of community-living elderly volunteers, both nondemented and minimally cognitively impaired, followed up for up to 9.5 years. Neuropathologic examinations were performed on participants who had undergone autopsy. Setting: An AD research center. Participants: All participants enrolled between July 1990 and June 1997 with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores of 0 (cognitively healthy; n = 177; mean age, 78.9 years) or 0.5 (equivalent to MCI; n = 277; mean age, 76.9 years). Based on the degree of clinical confidence that MCI represented dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), 3 subgroups of individuals with CDR scores of 0.5 were identified: CDR 0.5/DAT, CDR 0.5/incipient DAT, and CDR 0.5/uncertain dementia. Main Outcome Measure: Progression to the stage of CDR 1, which characterizes mild definite DAT. Results: Survival analysis showed that 100% of CDR 0.5/ DAT participants progressed to greater dementia severity over a 9.5-year period. At 5 years, rates of progression to a score of CDR 1 (or greater) for DAT were 60.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.2%-70.8%) for the CDR 0.5/DAT group, 35.7% (95% CI, 21.0%-50.3%) for the CDR 0.5/incipient DAT group, 19.9% (95% CI, 8.0%-31.8%) for the CDR 0.5/uncertain dementia group, and 6.8% (95% CI, 2.2%-11.3%) for CDR 0/controls. Progression to greater dementia severity correlated with degree of cognitive impairment at baseline. Twenty-four of the 25 participants with scores of CDR 0.5 had a neuropathologic dementing disorder, which was AD in 21 (84%). Conclusion: Individuals currently characterized as having MCI progress steadily to greater stages of dementia severity at rates dependent on the level of cognitive impairment at entry and they almost always have the neuropathologic features of AD. We conclude that MCI generally represents early-stage AD.",0.36512575,0.35799164,0.40350068,0.38914573,0.38918644,0.3932847,0.37045392,0.35081807,0.4284345,0.35099825,0.3992569,0.3568354,0.39039224,0.37593994,Mild cognitive impairment represents early-stage Alzheimer disease,1/1/2001,,J.

Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to dementia and the associated biosignatures has recently received increasing attention in AD research. Different biosignatures for AD (neuroimaging, demographic, genetic and cognitive measures) may contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis of AD.Methods: We have conducted a comprehensive study using a large number of samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to test the power of integrating various baseline data for predicting the conversion from MCI to probable AD and identifying a small subset of biosignatures for the prediction and assess the relative importance of different modalities in predicting MCI to AD conversion. We have employed sparse logistic regression with stability selection for the integration and selection of potential predictors. Our study differs from many of the other ones in three important respects: (1) we use a large cohort of MCI samples that are unbiased with respect to age or education status between case and controls (2) we integrate and test various types of baseline data available in ADNI including MRI, demographic, genetic and cognitive measures and (3) we apply sparse logistic regression with stability selection to ADNI data for robust feature selection.Results: We have used 319 MCI subjects from ADNI that had MRI measurements at the baseline and passed quality control, including 177 MCI Non-converters and 142 MCI Converters. Conversion was considered over the course of a 4-year follow-up period. A combination of 15 features (predictors) including those from MRI scans, APOE genotyping, and cognitive measures achieves the best prediction with an AUC score of 0.8587.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the power of integrating various baseline data for prediction of the conversion from MCI to probable AD. Our results also demonstrate the effectiveness of stability selection for feature selection in the context of sparse logistic regression. © 2012 Ye et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0.44340262,0.5492878,0.5719858,0.52407736,0.48938745,0.4397077,0.44318464,0.4407012,0.49069703,0.4735802,0.48117957,0.444686,0.48745406,0.48730448,Sparse learning and stability selection for predicting MCI to AD conversion using baseline ADNI data,6/25/2012,,Jieping Ye; Michael Farnum; Eric Yang; Rudi Verbeeck; Victor Lobanov; Nandini Raghavan; Gerald Novak; Allitia DiBernardo; Vaibhav A.

Here, we compared the predictive performance of three machine learning classifiers using differing combinations of sociodemographic characteristics, baseline clinical self-reports, cognitive tests, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features to predict treatment outcomes in late-life depression (LLD). Methods: Data were combined from two clinical trials conducted with depressed adults aged 60 and older, including response to escitalopram (N = 32, NCT01902004) and Tai Chi (N = 35, NCT02460666). Remission was defined as a score of 6 or less on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) at the end of 24 weeks of treatment. Features subsets were constructed from baseline sociodemographic and clinical features, gray matter volumes (GMVs), or both. Three classification algorithms were compared: (1) Support Vector Machine-Radial Bias Function (SVMRBF), (2) Random Forest (RF), and (3) Logistic Regression (LR). A repeated 5-fold cross-validation approach with a wrapper-based feature selection method was used for model fitting. Model performance metrics included Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Cross-validated performance significance was tested by permutation analysis. Classifiers were compared by Cochran's Q and post-hoc pairwise comparisons using McNemar's Chi-Square test with Bonferroni correction. Results: For the RF and SVMRBF algorithms, the combined feature set outperformed the clinical and GMV feature sets with a final cross-validated AUC of 0.83 ± 0.11 and 0.80 ± 0.11, respectively. Both classifiers passed permutation analysis. The LR algorithm performed best using GMV features alone (AUC 0.79 ± 0.14) but failed to pass permutation analysis using any feature set. Performance of the three classifiers differed significantly for all three features sets. Important predictive features of treatment response included anterior and posterior cingulate volumes, depression characteristics, and self-reported health-related quality scores. Conclusion: This preliminary exploration into the use of ML and multi-modal data to identify predictors of general treatment response in LLD indicates that integration of clinical and structural MRI features significantly increases predictive capability.

Moreover, accurate prediction of the progress and the conversion risk from MCI to probable AD has been of great importance in clinical application. Methods: In this study, the baseline MR images and follow-up information during 3 years of 150 normal controls (NC), 150 patients with stable MCI (sMCI) and 157 converted MCI (cMCI) were collected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were adopted to distinguish different stages of MCI from the NC group, and predict the conversion time from MCI to AD. Two CNN architectures including GoogleNet and CaffeNet were explored and evaluated in multiple classifications and estimations of conversion risk using transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) and five-fold cross-validation. A novel data augmentation approach using random views aggregation was applied to generate abundant image patches from the original MR scans. Results: The GoogleNet acquired accuracies with 97.58%, 67.33% and 84.71% in three-way discrimination among the NC, sMCI and cMCI groups respectively, whereas the CaffeNet obtained promising accuracies of 98.71%, 72.04% and 92.35% in the NC, sMCI and cMCI classifications. Furthermore, the accuracy measures of conversion risk of patients with cMCI ranged from 71.25% to 83.25% in different time points using GoogleNet, whereas the CaffeNet achieved remarkable accuracy measures from 95.42% to 97.01% in conversion risk prediction. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods had prominent capability in classification among the 3 groups such as sMCI, cMCI and NC, and exhibited significant ability in conversion risk prediction of patients with MCI.",0.47783703,0.5181596,0.5403866,0.51486486,0.57229555,0.520439,0.51009375,0.5120243,0.5089539,0.5532128,0.578531,0.5339157,0.6033338,0.56748337,Discrimination and conversion prediction of mild cognitive impairment using convolutional neural networks,11/1/2018,,Congling Wu; Shengwen Guo; Yanjia Hong; Benheng Xiao; Yupeng Wu; Qin Zhang,Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery,46,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058181437&origin=inward,,,,992-1003,2018,"@article{,

The primary goal of this study was to assess the effects of imaging modalities and brain atlases on prediction. We also investigated the influence of support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) on predictive performance. Methods: Eighty individuals with amnestic MCI [40 developed AD within 3 years] underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans at baseline. Using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) and LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40), we extracted features representing gray matter density and relative cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in each region of interest from the baseline MRI and FDG-PET data, respectively. We used linear SVM ensemble with bagging and computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure of classification performance. We performed multiple SVM-RFE to compute feature ranking. We performed analysis of variance on the mean AUCs for eight feature sets. Results: The interactions between atlas and modality choices were significant. The main effect of SVM-RFE was significant, but the interactions with the other factors were not significant. Comparison with existing method: Multimodal features were found to be better than unimodal features to predict AD. FDG-PET was found to be better than MRI.

To achieve low-cost high-accuracy diagnose performance for dementia using a neuropsychological battery, a novel framework is proposed using the response profiles of 2666 cognitively normal elderly individuals and 435 dementia patients who have participated in the Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia (KLOSCAD). Methods: The key idea of the proposed framework is to propose a cost-effective and precise two-stage classification procedure that employed Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) as a screening test and the KLOSCAD Neuropsychological Assessment Battery as a diagnostic test using deep learning. In addition, an evaluation procedure of redundant variables is introduced to prevent performance degradation. A missing data imputation method is also presented to increase the robustness by recovering information loss. The proposed deep neural networks (DNNs) architecture for the classification is validated through rigorous evaluation in comparison with various classifiers. Results: The k-nearest-neighbor imputation has been induced according to the proposed framework, and the proposed DNNs for two stage classification show the best accuracy compared to the other classifiers. Also, 49 redundant variables were removed, which improved diagnostic performance and suggested the potential of simplifying the assessment. Using this two-stage framework, we could get 8.06% higher diagnostic accuracy of dementia than MMSE alone and 64.13% less cost than KLOSCAD-N alone.

Some individuals remain cognitively intact despite the presence of significant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, whereas others manifest cognitive symptoms and dementia in the same context. The aim of the present study was to examine cognitive and cerebral reserve factors associated with resilient functioning in the setting of AD pathology. Methods: University of Pennsylvania Alzheimer's Disease Center research participants with biochemical biomarker evidence of AD pathology (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β 1-42 <192 pg/mL) and comparable medial temporal lobe atrophy were categorized by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score as AD dementia (CDR-SOB >1) or AD resilient (CDR-SOB ≤0.5). Groups were compared for a variety of demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging variables to identify factors that are associated with resilience to AD pathology. Results: A univariate model identified education and intracranial volume (ICV) as significant covariates. In a multivariate model with backward selection procedure, ICV was retained as a factor most significantly associated with resilience. The interaction term between ICV and education was not significant, suggesting that larger cranial vault size is associated with resilience even in the absence of more education. Conclusions: Premorbid brain volume, as measured through ICV, provided protection against clinical manifestations of dementia despite evidence of significant accumulations of AD pathology.

Many neuroimaging studies have focused on case–control classification and predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease, but predicting scores from clinical assessments (such as the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale or the Mini Mental State Examination) using MRI data has received less attention. Predicting clinical scores can be crucial in providing a nuanced prognosis and inferring symptomatic severity. Methods: We predicted clinical scores at the individual level using a novel anatomically partitioned artificial neural network (APANN) model. The model combined input from 2 structural MRI measures relevant to the neurodegenerative patterns observed in Alzheimer disease: Hippocampal segmentations and cortical thickness. We evaluated the performance of the APANN model with 10 rounds of 10-fold cross-validation in 3 experiments, using cohorts from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): ADNI1, ADNI2 and ADNI1 + 2. Results: Pearson correlation and root mean square error between the actual and predicted scores on the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADNI1: R = 0.60; ADNI2: R = 0.68; ADNI1 + 2: R = 0.63) and Mini Mental State Examination (ADNI1: R = 0.52; ADNI2: R = 0.55; ADNI1 + 2: R = 0.55) showed that APANN can accurately infer clinical severity from MRI data. Limitations: To rigorously validate the model, we focused primarily on large cross-sectional baseline data sets with only proof-of-concept longitudinal results.

New method: We proposed to use an ensemble of support vector machines (SVMs) that combined bagging without replacement and feature selection. SVM is the most commonly used algorithm in multivariate classification of dementia, and it was therefore valuable to evaluate the potential benefit of ensembling this type of classifier. Results: The ensemble SVM, using either a linear or a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, achieved multi-class classification accuracies of 55.6% and 55.0% in the challenge test set (60 NC, 60 MCI, 60 cMCI, 60 AD), resulting in a third place in the challenge. Similar feature subset sizes were obtained for both kernels, and the most frequently selected MRI features were the volumes of the two hippocampal subregions left presubiculum and right subiculum. Post-challenge analysis revealed that enforcing a minimum number of selected features and increasing the number of ensemble classifiers improved classification accuracy up to 59.1%. Comparison with existing method(s): The ensemble SVM outperformed single SVM classifications consistently in the challenge test set.

Scholars often use computer vision and machine learning methods to develop an automatic diagnosis system. Objective: In this study, we developed a novel machine learning system that can make diagnoses automatically from brain magnetic resonance images. Methods: First, the brain imaging was processed, including skull stripping and spatial normalization. Second, one axial slice was selected from the volumetric image, and stationary wavelet entropy (SWE) was done to extract the texture features. Third, a single-hidden-layer neural network was used as the classifier. Finally, a predator-prey particle swarm optimization was proposed to train the weights and biases of the classifier. Results: Our method used 4-level decomposition and yielded 13 SWE features. The classification yielded an overall accuracy of 92.73±1.03%, a sensitivity of 92.69±1.29%, and a specificity of 92.78±1.51%. The area under the curve is 0.95±0.02.

Objective: To determine the pathologic substrates of dementia in cases with prior diagnosis of amnestic MCI. Design and Setting: Community-based cohort. Patients: Thirty-four subjects followed up prospectively as part of a community-based study who were diagnosed with amnestic MCI, progressed to clinical dementia, and underwent subsequent postmortem brain analysis. Main Outcome Measures: Neuropathologic analyses resulted in assignment of a primary pathologic diagnosis and included staging of Alzheimer pathologic abnormalities and identification of contributing vascular disease, Lewy bodies, and argyrophilic grains. Results: Although the majority of subjects progressed both clinically and pathologically to Alzheimer disease (AD), 10 (29%) of them developed non-AD primary pathologic abnormalities. All of the cases were found to have sufficient pathologic abnormalities in mesial temporal lobe structures to account for their amnestic symptoms regardless of the cause. Most subjects were found to have secondary contributing pathologic abnormalities in addition to primary pathologic diagnoses. No significant differences between subjects with and without neuropathologically proven AD were detected in demographic variables, apolipoprotein E genotype, or cognitive test measures at onset of MCI, onset of dementia, or last clinical evaluation. Conclusions: The neuropathologic outcome of amnestic MCI following progression to dementia is heterogeneous, and it includes AD at a high frequency. Complex neuropathologic findings including 2 or more distinct pathologic entities contributing to dementia may be common in community-based cohorts. Neither demographic variables nor cognitive measures had predictive value in determining which patients diagnosed with MCI will develop the neuropathologic features of AD. ©2006 American Medical Association.

Methods: The study used systematic review of studies published in English since 1984. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Population-based observational studies of incidence or prevalence of MCI and related terms were eligible for inclusion. Results: A total of 3,705 citations were identified, and 42 were accepted for inclusion; 35 included data on prevalence and 13 on incidence. The following four terms predominated: age-associated memory impairment (AAMI); cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND); MCI; and amnestic MCI (aMCI). Within each term, the operational definition varied. Substantial variation was observed for both incidence (MCI: 21.5-71.3; aMCI: 8.5-25.9 per 1,000 person-years) and prevalence of each definition of cognitive impairment (AAMI 3.6%-38.4%; CIND 5.1%-35.9%; MCI 3%-42%; aMCI 0.5%-31.9%). CIND and MCI showed increasing prevalence among older age groups, whereas age-specific rates of aMCI were lower and without any apparent age relationship. Conclusions: Prevalence and incidence estimates associated with MCI vary greatly both between definitions and within a definition across the 42 publications. These wide differences pose a significant challenge to our understanding of the social burden of this disease. Enhancement and standardization of operational definitions of the subtypes of cognitive impairment could improve estimates of disease burden and provide a mechanism to assist in the identification of individuals at risk for future Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. © 2012 The Alzheimers Association.

These approaches learn abstract neuroanatomical and functional brain alterations that could enable exceptional performance in classification of brain disorders, predicting disease progression, and localizing brain abnormalities. New Method: This work investigates the suitability of a modified form of deep residual neural networks (ResNet) for studying neuroimaging data in the specific application of predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prediction was conducted first by training the deep models using MCI individuals only, followed by a domain transfer learning version that additionally trained on AD and controls. We also demonstrate a network occlusion based method to localize abnormalities. Results: The implemented framework captured non-linear features that successfully predicted AD progression and also conformed to the spectrum of various clinical scores. In a repeated cross-validated setup, the learnt predictive models showed highly similar peak activations that corresponded to previous AD reports. Comparison with existing methods: The implemented architecture achieved a significant performance improvement over the classical support vector machine and the stacked autoencoder frameworks (p < 0.005), numerically better than state-of-the-art performance using sMRI data alone (> 7% than the second-best performing method) and within 1% of the state-of-the-art performance considering learning using multiple neuroimaging modalities as well.

Changes in the levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau protein and β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42) peptide in patients with AD have been well documented, but the relationship between these biomarkers and neuropathologic changes in the brain is not established. Objective: To study the relationship between antemortem CSF biomarker levels and Alzheimer-type neuropathologic changes in the brain. Design: Cross-sectional study to correlate levels of CSF Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau protein with neuropathologic changes in the brain. Setting: Academic research. Patients: The study included 123 patients (79 with clinically diagnosed AD, 29 with other dementia, and 15 with other neurologic disease). All underwent clinical evaluation and provided antemortem lumbar CSF samples, and neuropathologic data were collected from September 11, 1990, to March 13, 2003, in the Department of Neuroscience and Neurology, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland. Main Outcome Measures: Levels of CSF Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau protein were measured using standard commercial immunoassays. Neuropathologic evaluations included the classic silver impregnation method and immunohistochemistry for Aβ, hyperphosphorylated tau, and α-synuclein. Results: Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 and tau protein levels were related to amyloid load and the presence of neurofibrillary pathologic abnormalities in the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 level correlated inversely with total Aβ load in the brain, and CSF tau level correlated with results of immunohistochemistry for hyperphosphorylated tau and with the presence of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of neuritic plaques in the brain remained a significant predictor of decreased CSF Aβ42 level and of increased CSF tau level. Based on the ratio of phosphorylated tau level to Aβ42 level, sensitivity was 91.6%, and specificity was 85.7%, with an overall accuracy of 90.2% for the presence of pathologic neuritic plaque in the brain. Conclusions: Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 and tau proteins are biomarkers of AD-associated pathologic changes in the brain. The combination of abnormally low CSF Aβ42 level and abnormally high CSF tau level predicted the presence of AD pathologic features with high accuracy. This combination assay may be helpful in diagnosing the presence of AD pathologic changes in the brain. ©2009 American Medical Association.

We evaluate the performance of MRI-based neuromorphometrics features (nMF) in the classification of Healthy Controls (HC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), converters MCI (cMCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. New methods: We propose to segregate participants in three groups according to Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSEs), searching for the main nMF in each group. Then we use them to develop a Multi Classifier System (MCS). We compare the MCS against a single classifier scheme using both MMSEs+nMF and nMF only. We repeat this comparison using three state-of-the-art classification algorithms. Results: The MCS showed the best performance on both Accuracy and Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) in comparison with single classifiers. The multiclass AUC for the MCS classification on Test Dataset were 0.83 for HC, 0.76 for cMCI, 0.65 for MCI and 0.95 for AD. Furthermore, MCS's optimum accuracy on Neurodegenerative Disease (ND) detection (AD+cMCI vs MCI+HC) was 81.0% (AUC = 0.88), while the single classifiers got 71.3% (AUC = 0.86) and 63.1% (AUC = 0.79) for MMSEs+nMF and only nMF respectively. Comparison with existing method: The proposed MCS showed a better performance than using all nMF into a single state-of-the-art classifier.

Methods: The method employed 3D data of 178 subjects consisting of 97 NCs, 57 MCIs, and 24 ADs. First, all these 3D MR images were preprocessed with atlas-registered normalization to form an averaged volumetric image. Then, 3D discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) was used to extract wavelet coefficients the volumetric image. The triplets (energy, variance, and Shannon entropy) of all subbands coefficients of 3D-DWT were obtained as feature vector. Afterwards, principle component analysis (PCA) was applied for feature reduction. On the basic of the reduced features, we proposed nine classification methods: three individual classifiers as linear SVM, kernel SVM, and kernel SVM trained by PSO with time-varying acceleration-coefficient (PSOTVAC), with three multiclass methods as Winner-Takes-All (WTA), Max-Wins-Voting, and Directed Acyclic Graph. Results: The 5-fold cross validation results showed that the ""WTA-KSVM + PSOTVAC"" performed best over the OASIS benchmark dataset, with overall accuracy of 81.5% among all proposed nine classifiers. Moreover, the method ""WTA-KSVM + PSOTVAC"" exceeded significantly existing state-of-the-art methods (accuracies of which were less than or equal to 74.0%).

We have developed a software named BAAD, which uses ML algorithms for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression. Methods: We constructed an algorithm by combining a support vector machine (SVM) to classify and a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to reduce concerned variables. We grouped progressive MCI and AD as an AD spectrum and trained SVM according to this classification. We randomly selected half from the total 1,314 subjects of AD neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) from North America for SVM training, and the remaining half were used for validation to fine-tune the model hyperparameters. We created two types of SVMs, one based solely on the brain structure (SVMst), and the other based on both the brain structure and Mini-Mental State Examination score (SVMcog). We compared the model performance with two expert neuroradiologists, and further evaluated it in test datasets involving 519, 592, 69, and 128 subjects from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Aging (AIBL), Japanese ADNI, the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in AD (MIDIAD) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), respectively. Results: BAAD's SVMs outperformed radiologists for AD diagnosis in a structural magnetic resonance imaging review. The accuracy of the two radiologists was 57.5 and 70.0%, respectively, whereas, that of the SVMst was 90.5%. The diagnostic accuracy of the SVMst and SVMcog in the test datasets ranged from 88.0 to 97.1% and 92.5 to 100%, respectively. The prediction accuracy for MCI progression was 83.0% in SVMst and 85.0% in SVMcog. In the AD spectrum classified by SVMst, 87.1% of the subjects were Aβ positive according to an AV-45 positron emission tomography.

Objective: However, some of these methods are unable to achieve excellent detection accuracy, and several other methods are unable to locate AD-related regions. Hence, our goal was to develop a novel AD brain detection method. Methods: In this study, our method was based on the three-dimensional (3D) displacement-field (DF) estimation between subjects in the healthy elder control group and AD group. The 3D-DF was treated with AD-related features. The three feature selection measures were used in the Bhattacharyya distance, Student's t-test, andWelch's t-test (WTT). Two non-parallel support vector machines, i.e., generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine and twin support vector machine (TSVM), were then used for classification. A 50×10-fold cross validation was implemented for statistical analysis. Results: The results showed that 3D-DF+WTT+TSVM achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 93.05±2.18, a sensitivity of 92.57±3.80, a specificity of 93.18±3.35, and a precision of 79.51±2.86. This method also exceled in 13 state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we were able to detect 17 regions related to AD by using the pure computer-vision technique.

Whilst there has been success in modeling the progression of AD related clinical biomarkers and image derived features over the course of the disease, modeling the expected progression as observed by magnetic resonance (MR) images directly remains a challenge. Here, we apply some recently developed ideas from the field of generative adversarial networks (GANs) which provide a powerful way to model and manipulate MR images directly though the technique of image arithmetic. This allows for synthetic images based upon an individual subject's MR image to be produced expressing different levels of the features associated with AD. We demonstrate how the model can be used to both introduce and remove AD-like features from two regions in the brain, and show that these predicted changes correspond well to the observed changes over a longitudinal examination. We also propose a modification to the GAN training procedure to encourage the model to better represent the more extreme cases of AD present in the dataset. We show the benefit of this modification by comparing the ability of the resulting models to encode and reconstruct real images with high atrophy and other unusual features.",0.5150774,0.55916196,0.5541823,0.55526286,0.546933,0.50442356,0.49151212,0.46970385,0.52408844,0.54191124,0.55308276,0.56749636,0.53607386,0.5240174,Modelling the progression of Alzheimer's disease in MRI using generative adversarial networks,1/1/2018,,Christopher Bowles; Roger Gunn; Alexander Hammers; Daniel Rueckert,Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE,31,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047341082&origin=inward,,,,,2018,"@article{,

Biomarkers for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (BIOMARKAPD) is a European multicenter study, funded by the EU Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research, which aims to improve the clinical use of body fluid markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective was to standardize the assessment of existing assays and to validate novel fluid biomarkers for AD and PD. To support the validation of novel biomarkers and assays, a central and a virtual biobank for body fluids and associated data from subjects with neurodegenerative diseases have been established. In the central biobank, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples were collected according to the BIOMARKAPD standardized pre-analytical procedures and stored at Integrated BioBank of Luxembourg. The virtual biobank provides an overview of available CSF, plasma, serum, and DNA samples at each site. Currently, at the central biobank of BIOMARKAPD samples are available from over 400 subjects with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), vascular dementia, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, PD, PD with dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. The virtual biobank contains information on over 8,600 subjects with varying diagnoses from 21 local biobanks.

One of the presymptomatic hallmarks of AD is the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the human brain. However, current methods to detect Aβ pathology are either invasive (lumbar puncture) or quite costly and not widely available (amyloid PET). Our prior studies show that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based hippocampal multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) are an effective neurodegenerative biomarker for preclinical AD. Here we attempt to use MRI-MMS to make inferences regarding brain Aβ burden at the individual subject level. As MMS data has a larger dimension than the sample size, we propose a sparse coding algorithm, Patch Analysis-based Surface Correntropy-induced Sparse-coding and Max-Pooling (PASCS-MP), to generate a low-dimensional representation of hippocampal morphometry for each individual subject. Then we apply these individual representations and a binary random forest classifier to predict brain Aβ positivity for each person. We test our method in two independent cohorts, 841 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 260 subjects from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). Experimental results suggest that our proposed PASCS-MP method and MMS can discriminate Aβ positivity in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [Accuracy (ACC) = 0.89 (ADNI)] and in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals [ACC = 0.79 (ADNI) and ACC = 0.81 (OASIS)]. These results compare favorably relative to measures derived from traditional algorithms, including hippocampal volume and surface area, shape measures based on spherical harmonics (SPHARM) and our prior Patch Analysis-based Surface Sparse-coding and Max-Pooling (PASS-MP) methods.",0.5042312,0.5487019,0.54720074,0.5747077,0.5127946,0.5058453,0.4823459,0.4806718,0.5404006,0.51061684,0.54503953,0.5204945,0.5200211,0.55970466,"Predicting Brain Amyloid Using Multivariate Morphometry Statistics, Sparse Coding, and Correntropy: Validation in 1,101 Individuals From the ADNI and OASIS Databases",8/6/2021,,Jianfeng Wu; Qunxi Dong; Jie Gui; Jie Zhang; Yi Su; Kewei Chen; Paul M.

No single biomarker can predict future cognitive decline with an acceptable level of accuracy. In addition to designing powerful multimodal diagnostic platforms, a careful investigation of the major sources of disease heterogeneity and their influence on biomarker changes is needed. Here we investigated the accuracy of a novel multimodal biomarker classifier for differentiating cognitively normal (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects with and without stratification by ApoE4 genotype. 111 NC, 182 MCI and 95 AD ADNI participants provided both structural MRI and CSF data at baseline. We used an automated machine-learning classifier to test the ability of hippocampal volume and CSF Aβ, t-tau and p-tau levels, both separately and in combination, to differentiate NC, MCI and AD subjects, and predict conversion. We hypothesized that the combined hippocampal/CSF biomarker classifier model would achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating between the three diagnostic groups and that ApoE4 genotype will affect both diagnostic accuracy and biomarker selection. The combined hippocampal/CSF classifier performed better than hippocampus-only classifier in differentiating NC from MCI and NC from AD. It also outperformed the CSF-only classifier in differentiating NC vs. AD. Our amyloid marker played a role in discriminating NC from MCI or AD but not for MCI vs. AD. Neurodegenerative markers contributed to accurate discrimination of AD from NC and MCI but not NC from MCI. Classifiers predicting MCI conversion performed well only after ApoE4 stratification. Hippocampal volume and sex achieved AUC = 0.68 for predicting conversion in the ApoE4-positive MCI, while CSF p-tau, education and sex achieved AUC = 0.89 for predicting conversion in ApoE4-negative MCI. These observations support the proposed biomarker trajectory in AD, which postulates that amyloid markers become abnormal early in the disease course while markers of neurodegeneration become abnormal later in the disease course and suggests that ApoE4 could be at least partially responsible for some of the observed disease heterogeneity. © 2013 The Authors.",0.5126855,0.5355655,0.6020804,0.57529026,0.50426775,0.48691887,0.49612132,0.48654947,0.5685754,0.51175064,0.5345607,0.50799346,0.53326553,0.54569876,ApoE4 effects on automated diagnostic classifiers for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease,1/1/2014,,Liana G.

These have been used in many studies in which the goal has been to distinguish between pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and healthy aging. However, other dementias, in particular, frontotemporal dementia, also present overlapping pathological brain morphometry patterns. Hence, a classifier that can discriminate morphometric features from a brain MRI from the three classes of normal aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) would offer considerable utility in aiding in correct group identification. Compared to the conventional use of multiple pair-wise binary classifiers that learn to discriminate between two classes at each stage, we propose a single three-way classification system that can discriminate between three classes at the same time. We present a novel classifier that is able to perform a three-class discrimination test for discriminating among AD, FTD, and normal controls (NC) using volumes, shape invariants, and local displacements (three features) of hippocampi and lateral ventricles (two structures times two hemispheres individually) obtained from brain MR images. In order to quantify its utility in correct discrimination, we optimize the three-class classifier on a training set and evaluate its performance using a separate test set. This is a novel, first-of-its-kind comparative study of multiple individual biomarkers in a three-class setting.

Indicators of amyloid deposition such as 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) PET are primarily used to identify or rule out brain diseases that are associated with amyloid pathology but have also been deployed to forecast the clinical course. Indicators of neuronal metabolism incluDing 18F-FDG PET demonstrate the localization and severity of neuronal dysfunction and are valuable for differential diagnosis and for predicting the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. It is a matter of debate whether to analyze these images visually or using automated techniques. Therefore, we compared the usefulness of both imaging methods and both analyzing strategies to predict dementia due to AD. Methods: In MCI participants, a baseline examination, incluDing clinical and imaging assessments, and a clinical follow-up examination after a planned interval of 24 mo were performed. Results: Of 28 MCI patients, 9 developed dementia due to AD, 2 developed frontotemporal dementia, and 1 developed moderate dementia of unknown etiology. The positive and negative predictive values and the accuracy of visual and fully automated analyses of 11C-PiB for the prediction of progression to dementia due to AD were 0.50, 1.00, and 0.68, respectively, for the visual and 0.53, 1.00, and 0.71, respectively, for the automated analyses. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of fully automated analyses of 18F-FDG PET were 0.37, 0.78, and 0.50, respectively. Results of visual analyses were highly variable between raters but were superior to automated analyses. Conclusion: Both 18F-FDG and 11C-PiB imaging appear to be of limited use for predicting the progression from MCI to dementia due to AD in short-term follow-up, irrespective of the strategy of analysis.

Structural and functional neuroimaging modalities are commonly used by physicians to aid the diagnosis of brain diseases. In clinical settings, specialist doctors typically fuse the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data with other neuroimaging modalities for brain disease detection. As these two approaches offer complementary information, fusing these neuroimaging modalities helps physicians accurately diagnose brain diseases. Typically, fusion is performed between a functional and a structural neuroimaging modality. Because the functional modality can complement the structural modality information, thus improving the performance for the diagnosis of brain diseases by specialists. However, analyzing the fusion of neuroimaging modalities is difficult for specialist doctors. Deep Learning (DL) is a branch of artificial intelligence that has shown superior performances compared to more conventional methods in tasks such as brain disease detection from neuroimaging modalities. This work presents a comprehensive review paper in the field of brain disease detection from the fusion of neuroimaging modalities using DL models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), pretrained, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and Autoencoders (AEs). First, neuroimaging modalities and the need for fusion are discussed. Then, review papers published in the field of neuroimaging multimodalities using AI techniques are explored. Moreover, fusion levels based on DL methods, including input, layer, and decision, with related studies conducted on diagnosing brain diseases, are discussed.

2057,https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.22531,3.92E-05,5,6,"Brain morphometry based classification from magnetic resonance (MR) acquisitions has been widely investigated in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In the literature, a morphometric representation of brain structures is obtained by spatial normalization of each image into a common space (i.e., a pre-defined atlas) via non-linear registration, thus the corresponding regions in different brains can be compared. However, representations generated from one single atlas may not be sufficient to reveal the underlying anatomical differences between the groups of disease-affected patients and normal controls (NC). In this article, we propose a different methodology, namely the multi-atlas based morphometry, which measures morphometric representations of the same image in different spaces of multiple atlases. Representations generated from different atlases can thus provide the complementary information to discriminate different groups, and also reduce the negative impacts from registration errors. Specifically, each studied subject is registered to multiple atlases, where adaptive regional features are extracted. Then, all features from different atlases are jointly selected by a correlation and relevance based scheme, followed by final classification with the support vector machine (SVM). We have evaluated the proposed method on 459 subjects (97 AD, 117 progressive-MCI (p-MCI), 117 stable-MCI (s-MCI), and 128 NC) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and achieved 91.64% for AD/NC classification and 72.41% for p-MCI/s-MCI classification. Our results clearly demonstrate that the proposed multi-atlas based method can significantly outperform the previous single-atlas based methods.",0.5440842,0.5638001,0.5904962,0.56943655,0.5267279,0.4098105,0.48443797,0.4847212,0.5177083,0.5340511,0.49827993,0.50144374,0.5105993,0.60348725,Multi-atlas based representations for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,10/1/2014,,Rui Min; Guorong Wu; Jian Cheng; Qian Wang; Dinggang Shen,Human Brain Mapping,67,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84927578310&origin=inward,,,,5052-5070,2014,"@article{,

In our previous study, we proposed an AD classification approach based on individual hierarchical networks constructed with 3D texture features of brain images. However, we only used edge features of the networks without node features of the networks. In this paper, we propose a framework of the combination of multiple kernels to combine edge features and node features for AD classification.

Experimental results show that the proposed method is not only superior to the existing AD classification methods, but also efficient and promising for clinical applications for the diagnosis of AD via MRI images.

In this prospective study we have used a novel longitudinal voxel-based method to map the progression of GM loss in MCI patients over time and compared converters to non-converters. Eighteen amnestic MCI patients were followed-up for a predefined fixed period of 18 months and conversion was judged according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. Each patient underwent a high-resolution T1-weighted volume MRI scan both at entry in the study and 18 months later. We used an optimal VBM protocol to compare baseline imaging data of converters to those of non-converters. Moreover, to map GM loss from baseline to follow-up assessment, we used a modified voxel-based morphometry (VBM) procedure specially designed for longitudinal studies. At the end of the follow-up period, seven patients had converted to probable AD. Areas of lower baseline GM value in converters mainly included the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and lingual and fusiform gyri. Regions of significant GM loss over the 18-month follow-up period common to both converters and non-converters included the temporal neocortex, parahippocampal cortex, orbitofrontal and inferior parietal areas, and the left thalamus. However, there was significantly greater GM loss in converters relative to non-converters in the hippocampal area, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and precuneus. This accelerated atrophy may result from both neurofibrillary tangles accumulation and parallel pathological processes such as functional alteration in the posterior cingulate. The ability to longitudinally assess GM changes in MCI offers new perspectives to better understand the pathological processes underlying AD and to monitor the effects of treatment on brain structure. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Due to feature redundancy or outliers in samples, using all available data for training a classifier may be suboptimal. For example, the Alzheimer's disease (AD) is correlated with certain brain regions or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identification of relevant features is critical for computer-aided diagnosis. Many existing methods first select features from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or SNPs and then use those features to build the classifier. However, with the presence of many redundant features, the most discriminative features are difficult to be identified in a single step. Thus, we formulate a hierarchical feature and sample selection framework to gradually select informative features and discard ambiguous samples in multiple steps for improved classifier learning. To positively guide the data manifold preservation process, we utilize both labeled and unlabeled data during training, making our method semi-supervised. For validation, we conduct experiments on AD diagnosis by selecting mutually informative features from both MRI and SNP, and using the most discriminative samples for training.

Although the large majority of the existing techniques rely on a single classifier such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), several ensemble methods such as Adaboost or Random Forests (RF) have also been explored. The ensemble methods combine the outputs of several classifiers and aim to increase performance by exploring the diversity of the base classifiers in terms of features or examples, which are usually randomly selected. In this paper we propose using a different kind of ensemble to address the three class problem of classifying AD, MCI and Control Normals (CN) from PET brain images. We propose the favourite class ensemble of classifiers where each base classifier in the ensemble uses a different feature subset which is optimized for a given class. Since different image features correspond to different sets of brain voxels, the proposed favourite class classifiers are able to take into account the fact that the spatial pattern of brain degeneration in AD changes in time as the disease progresses. We tested this approach on FDG-PET images from The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using as base classifiers both Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF).

Although additional data provide more information that might help to disambiguate between species, the variability in shape and appearance in plant organs also raises the degree of complexity of the problem. Despite promising solutions built using deep learning enable representative features to be learned for plant images, the existing approaches focus mainly on generic features for species classification, disregarding the features representing plant organs. In fact, plants are complex living organisms sustained by a number of organ systems. In our approach, we introduce a hybrid generic-organ convolutional neural network (HGO-CNN), which takes into account both organ and generic information, combining them using a new feature fusion scheme for species classification. Next, instead of using a CNN-based method to operate on one image with a single organ, we extend our approach. We propose a new framework for plant structural learning using the recurrent neural network-based method. This novel approach supports classification based on a varying number of plant views, capturing one or more organs of a plant, by optimizing the contextual dependencies between them. We also present the qualitative results of our proposed models based on feature visualization techniques and show that the outcomes of visualizations depict our hypothesis and expectation.

Towards this, we introduce a model which not only improves the disease prediction but also focuses on learning patient-specific order of importance for multi-modal data elements. In order to achieve this, we take advantage of LSTM-based attention mechanism and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to design our model.

Assuming that brain activation changes denote an advanced state of disease progression, changes in functional connectivity may precede changes in brain activation. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in functional connectivity of the right middle fusiform gyrus (FG) in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) during performance of a face-matching task. The right middle FG is a key area for processing face stimuli. Brain activity was measured using functional MRI. There were 16 MCI subjects and 19 age-matched healthy controls. The linear correlation coefficient was utilized as a measure of functional connectivity between the right middle FG and all other voxels in the brain. There were no statistical differences found in task performance or activation between groups. The right middle FG of the healthy control and MCI groups showed strong bilateral positive linear correlation with the visual cortex, inferior and superior parietal lobules, dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate. The healthy controls showed higher positive linear correlation of the right middle FG to the visual cortex, parietal lobes and right DLPFC than the MCI group, whereas the latter had higher positive linear correlation in the left cuneus. In the healthy controls, the right middle FG had negative linear correlation with right medial frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus and with left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), angular gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus, but the MCI group had negative linear correlation with the left IPL, angular gyrus, precuneus, anterior cingulate, and to right middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate gyrus. In the negatively linearly correlated regions, the MCI group had reduced functional connectivity to the frontal areas, right superior temporal gyrus and left IPL. Different regions of the cuneus and IPL had increased functional connectivity in either group. The putative presence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in MCI affects functional connectivity from the right middle FG to the visual areas and medial frontal areas. In addition, higher linear correlation in the MCI group in the parietal lobe may indicate the initial appearance of compensatory processes.

Early diagnosis allows the person to receive effective treatment benefits apart from helping him or her to remain independent longer. In this paper, different feature selection techniques are utilized with different classifiers in the classification of this chronic disease as normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on the MRI images of ADNI dataset. Dimensionality reduction plays a major role in improving classification performance when there are fewer records with high dimensions. After different trials to select the ample features, support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function kernel is found to produce better results with 96.82%, 89.39% and 90.40% accuracy for binary classification of NC/AD, NC/MCI and MCI/AD, respectively, with repeated tenfold stratified cross-validation.

However, it remains unclear how well the classifiers built on one population can predict MCI/AD diagnosis of other populations. This study aimed to employ a spectral graph convolutional neural network (graph-CNN), that incorporated cortical thickness and geometry, to identify MCI and AD based on 3089 T1-weighted MRI data of the ADNI-2 cohort, and to evaluate its feasibility to predict AD in the ADNI-1 cohort (n = 3602) and an Asian cohort (n = 347). For the ADNI-2 cohort, the graph-CNN showed classification accuracy of controls (CN) vs. AD at 85.8% and early MCI (EMCI) vs. AD at 79.2%, followed by CN vs. late MCI (LMCI) (69.3%), LMCI vs. AD (65.2%), EMCI vs. LMCI (60.9%), and CN vs. EMCI (51.8%). We demonstrated the robustness of the graph-CNN among the existing deep learning approaches, such as Euclidean-domain-based multilayer network and 1D CNN on cortical thickness, and 2D and 3D CNNs on T1-weighted MR images of the ADNI-2 cohort. The graph-CNN also achieved the prediction on the conversion of EMCI to AD at 75% and that of LMCI to AD at 92%. The find-tuned graph-CNN further provided a promising CN vs. AD classification accuracy of 89.4% on the ADNI-1 cohort and >90% on the Asian cohort.

In this work, we proposed a deep learning based framework for estimating multi-modality imaging data. Our method takes the form of convolutional neural networks, where the input and output are two volumetric modalities. The network contains a large number of trainable parameters that capture the relationship between input and output modalities. When trained on subjects with all modalities, the network can estimate the output modality given the input modality.

We use classical group analyses and automated machine learning classification of standard structural MRI scans to investigate AD diagnostic accuracy from the preclinical phase to clinical dementia. Longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were stratified into 4 groups according to the clinical status-(1) AD patients; (2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) converters; (3) MCI nonconverters; and (4) healthy controls-and submitted to a support vector machine. The obtained classifier was significantly above the chance level (62%) for detecting AD already 4 years before conversion from MCI. Voxel-based univariate tests confirmed the plausibility of our findings detecting a distributed network of hippocampal-temporoparietal atrophy in AD patients. We also identified a subgroup of control subjects with brain structure and cognitive changes highly similar to those observed in AD. Our results indicate that computational anatomy can detect AD substantially earlier than suggested by current models.

Individual prognosis is complicated by many factors including the definition of the prediction objective itself. In this work, we present a computational framework comprising machine-learning techniques for 1) modeling symptom trajectories and 2) prediction of symptom trajectories using multimodal and longitudinal data. We perform primary analyses on three cohorts from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and a replication analysis using subjects from Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). We model the prototypical symptom trajectory classes using clinical assessment scores from mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-13) at nine timepoints spanned over six years based on a hierarchical clustering approach. Subsequently we predict these trajectory classes for a given subject using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, genetic, and clinical variables from two timepoints (baseline + follow-up). For prediction, we present a longitudinal Siamese neural-network (LSN) with novel architectural modules for combining multimodal data from two timepoints. The trajectory modeling yields two (stable and decline) and three (stable, slow-decline, fast-decline) trajectory classes for MMSE and ADAS-13 assessments, respectively. For the predictive tasks, LSN offers highly accurate performance with 0.900 accuracy and 0.968 AUC for binary MMSE task and 0.760 accuracy for 3-way ADAS-13 task on ADNI datasets, as well as, 0.724 accuracy and 0.883 AUC for binary MMSE task on replication AIBL dataset.",0.4777436,0.5372919,0.5968941,0.5489426,0.5210072,0.541201,0.5011591,0.48245186,0.5336938,0.48312998,0.53265357,0.47700322,0.5068683,0.5160618,Modeling and prediction of clinical symptom trajectories in Alzheimer’s disease using longitudinal data,9/1/2018,,Nikhil Bhagwat; Joseph D.

Gray Matter (GM) images from each brain area have been split into 3D patches according to the regions defined by the AAL atlas and these patches are used to train different deep belief networks. An ensemble of deep belief networks is then composed where the final prediction is determined by a voting scheme. Two deep learning based structures and four different voting schemes are implemented and compared, giving as a result a potent classification architecture where discriminative features are computed in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting method has been evaluated using a large dataset from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Classification results assessed by cross-validation prove that the proposed method is not only valid for differentiate between controls (NC) and AD images, but it also provides good performances when tested for the more challenging case of classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Subjects.

Many algorithms are based on a relatively large training dataset. However, small hospitals are usually unable to collect sufficient training samples for robust classification. Although data sharing is expanding in scientific research, it is unclear whether a model based on one dataset is well suited for other data sources. Using a small dataset from a local hospital and a large shared dataset from the AD neuroimaging initiative, we conducted a heterogeneity analysis and found that different functional magnetic resonance imaging data sources show different sample distributions in feature space. In addition, we proposed an effective knowledge transfer method to diminish the disparity among different datasets and improve the classification accuracy on datasets with insufficient training samples. The accuracy increased by approximately 20% compared with that of a model based only on the original small dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach is a novel and effective method for CAD in hospitals with only small training datasets.

Several attempts have been made to adapt pattern recognition approaches to specific neuroimaging data such as Structural MRI (sMRI) for early AD diagnosis. One strategy is to boost the discrimination power of such approaches by integrating complementary imaging modalities in a single learning framework. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a new and promising modality giving complementary information to the anatomical MRI. However, including relevant DTI information from such modality is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to extract local image-derived biomarkers from DTI and sMRI to construct multimodal AD signatures. To assess the relevance of such modalities as well as to optimize the classifier, we integrate complementary information using a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework for AD subjects recognition. To evaluate our method, we perform experiments on a subset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Both T1-weighted MRI and Mean Diffusivity (MD) maps from the DTI modality of 45 AD patients, 52 Normal Control (NC) and 58 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects have been used. The obtained results indicate that our multimodal approach yields significant improvement in accuracy over using each single modality independently.

Due to the high number of coefficients when applying 3D-DWT to each of the VOIs, a feature selection algorithm based on mutual information is used, as is the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithm. Region optimization has been performed in order to discover the most relevant regions (VOIs) in the brain with the use of Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms, being one of the objectives to be optimize the accuracy of the system. The error index of the system is computed by the confusion matrix obtained by the multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used with the purpose of reducing the number of features to the classifier. The cohort of subjects used in the study consisted of 296 different patients. A first group of 206 patients was used to optimize VOI selection and another group of 90 independent subjects (that did not belong to the first group) was used to test the solutions yielded by the genetic algorithm. The proposed methodology obtains excellent results in multi-class classification achieving accuracies of 94.4% and also extracting significant information on the location of the most relevant points of the brain. This suggests that the proposed method could aid in the research of other neurodegenerative diseases, improving the accuracy of the diagnosis and finding the most relevant regions of the brain associated with them.",0.53866494,0.5403011,0.5521732,0.53939456,0.51025414,0.47208762,0.5005352,0.50227344,0.53490067,0.547841,0.5307792,0.5136173,0.5388731,0.6226575,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

In this study, we developed an extreme learning machine (ELM) model to discriminate between patients with AD and normal controls (NCs) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) obtained from magnetic resonance imaging. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and partial least squares (PLS) regression were compared with the ELM model. The calculated characteristics, i.e., texture features, VBM parameters, and clinical information, were adopted as the classification features. A 10-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of ELM, SVM, GPR, and PLS models. We applied the proposed methods to data from 58 patients with AD and 94 NCs, and achieved a classification accuracy of up to 0.96 with all classification features of the ELM model, while the results of the other three models were 0.82 (PLS), 0.79 (GPR), and 0.75 (SVM).

In this context, assessment of models' robustness to noise and imaging protocol differences together with post-processing and tuning strategies are key tasks to be addressed in order to move towards successful clinical applications. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Random Forest classifiers trained using different structural MRI measures, with and without neuroanatomical constraints in the detection and prediction of AD in terms of accuracy and between-cohort robustness. From The ADNI database, 185 AD, and 225 healthy controls (HC) were randomly split into training and testing datasets. 165 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were distributed according to the month of conversion to dementia (4-year follow-up). Structural 1.5-T MRI-scans were processed using Freesurfer segmentation and cortical reconstruction. Using the resulting output, AD/HC classifiers were trained. Training included model tuning and performance assessment using out-of-bag estimation. Subsequently the classifiers were validated on the AD/HC test set and for the ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion. Models' between-cohort robustness was additionally assessed using the AddNeuroMed dataset acquired with harmonized clinical and imaging protocols. In the ADNI set, the best AD/HC sensitivity/specificity (88.6%/92.0%-test set) was achieved by combining cortical thickness and volumetric measures. The Random Forest model resulted in significantly higher accuracy compared to the reference classifier (linear Support Vector Machine). The models trained using parcelled and high-dimensional (HD) input demonstrated equivalent performance, but the former was more effective in terms of computation/memory and time costs. The sensitivity/specificity for detecting MCI-to-AD conversion (but not AD/HC classification performance) was further improved from 79.5%/75%-83.3%/81.3% by a combination of morphometric measurements with ApoE-genotype and demographics (age, sex, education).

The relevance of individual features can be quantified from the SVM weights as a significance map (p-map). Although these p-maps previously showed clusters of relevant voxels in dementia-related brain regions, they have not yet been used for feature selection. Therefore, we introduce two novel feature selection methods based on p-maps using a direct approach (filter) and an iterative approach (wrapper). To evaluate these p-map feature selection methods, we compared them with methods based on the SVM weight vector directly, t-statistics, and expert knowledge. We used MRI data from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients who converted to AD (MCIc), MCI patients who did not convert to AD (MCInc), and cognitively normal controls (CN). Features for each voxel were derived from gray matter morphometry. Feature selection based on the SVM weights gave better results than t-statistics and expert knowledge. The p-map methods performed slightly better than those using the weight vector. The wrapper method scored better than the filter method. Recursive feature elimination based on the p-map improved most for AD-CN: the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) significantly increased from 90.3% without feature selection to 92.0% when selecting 1.5%-3% of the features. This feature selection method also improved the other classifications: AD-MCI 0.1% improvement in AUC (not significant), MCI-CN 0.7%, and MCIc-MCInc 0.1% (not significant).

As part of the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a major public health problem, the CAD system provides a neuropsychological assessment that helps mitigate its effects. The use of data fusion techniques by CAD systems has proven to be useful, they allow for the merging of information relating to the brain and its tissues from MRI, with that of other types of modalities. This multimodal fusion refines the quality of brain images by reducing redundancy and randomness, which contributes to improving the clinical reliability of the diagnosis compared to the use of a single modality.

Then to bring together some research work related to the diagnosis of brain disorders, emphasizing AD. Thus the most used methods in the stages of classification and brain regions segmentation are described, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Secondly, on the basis of the raised problem, we propose a solution within the framework of multimodal fusion.

In this study, we developed a computational framework using a suite of machine learning tools for identifying key markers in predicting the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a large set of biological and clinical measures. Six machine learning approaches, namely Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Support Vector Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor for regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbor for classification, were used for the development of predictive models. We demonstrated high predictive power of CFA. Predictive performance of models incorporating CFA was shown to consistently have higher accuracy than those based solely on biomarker modalities.

It is important to differentiate between them because of the differences in prognosis and treatment approaches. Objective: Investigate if sparse partial least squares (SPLS) classification of cortical thickness measurements could differentiate between AD and DLB. Methods: Two independent cohorts without MR-protocol alignment in Norway and Slovenia with 97 AD and DLB subjects were enrolled. Cortical thickness measurements acquired with Freesurfer were used in subsequent SPLS classification runs. The cohorts were analyzed separately and afterwards combined. The models were trained with leave-one-out cross validation and test datasets where used when available. To study the impact of MR-protocol alignment, the classifiers were additionally tested on sets drawn exclusively from the independent cohorts. Results: The obtained sensitivity/specificity/AUC values were 94.4/88.89/0.978 and 88.2/94.1/0.969 in the Norwegian and Slovenian cohorts, respectively. Both cohorts showed AD-associated pattern of thinning in mid-anterior temporal, occipital and subgenual cingulate cortex, whereas the pattern supportive for DLB included thinning in dorsal cingulate, posterior temporal and lateral orbitofrontal regions. When combining the cohorts, sensitivity/specificity/AUC were 82.1/85.7/0.948 for the training and 77.8/75/0.731 for the testing datasets with the same pattern-of-difference. The models tested on datasets drawn exclusively from the independent cohorts did not produce adequate accuracy. Conclusion: SPLS classification of cortical thickness is a good method for differentiating between AD and DLB, relatively stable even for mixed data, but not when tested on completely independent data drawn from different cohorts (without MR-protocol alignment). © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0.48126334,0.5194246,0.52984935,0.48466858,0.5146325,0.45248774,0.49014214,0.4811566,0.5458719,0.5153802,0.5299411,0.48760453,0.52770036,0.5316603,Multivariate classification of patients with Alzheimer's and dementia with Lewy bodies using high-dimensional cortical thickness measurements: An MRI surface-based morphometric study,4/1/2013,,Alexander V.

Starting point: Recently, Henry Rusinek and colleagues, in a 6-year longitudinal MRI study of initially healthy elderly subjects, showed that an increased rate of atrophy in the medial temporal lobe predicted future cognitive decline with a specificity of 91% and sensitivity of 89% (Radiology 2003; 229: 691-96). Where next? As understanding of neurodegenerative diseases increases, specific disease-modifying treatments might become available. Serial MRI could help to determine the efficacy of such treatments, which would be expected to slow the rate of atrophy towards that of normal ageing, and might also detect the onset of neurodegeneration. The amount and pattern of excess atrophy might help to predict the underlying pathological process, allowing specific therapies to be started. As the precision of imaging improves, the ability to distinguish healthy ageing from degenerative dementia should improve.",0.47477522,0.5086982,0.48966455,0.53295,0.4560871,0.47806054,0.42713484,0.40573955,0.49282187,0.45629475,0.47802684,0.47261307,0.452455,0.49484193,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

Given the subtle, mixed, and sparsely distributed brain atrophy patterns of schizophrenia, the capability of automatic feature learning makes CNN a powerful tool for classifying schizophrenia from controls as it removes the subjectivity in selecting relevant spatial features. To examine the feasibility of applying CNN to classification of schizophrenia and controls based on structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we built 3D CNN models with different architectures and compared their performance with a handcrafted feature-based machine learning approach. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as classifier and Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) was used as feature for handcrafted feature-based machine learning. 3D CNN models with sequential architecture, inception module and residual module were trained from scratch. CNN models achieved higher cross-validation accuracy than handcrafted feature-based machine learning. Moreover, testing on an independent dataset, 3D CNN models greatly outperformed handcrafted feature-based machine learning.

However, there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or what they have learned. In this paper, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is employed to classify brain MRI scans into two predefined groups. In addition, a genetic algorithm based brain masking (GABM) method is proposed as a visualization technique that provides new insights into the function of the 3D-CNN. The proposed GABM method consists of two main steps. In the first step, a set of brain MRI scans is used to train the 3D-CNN. In the second step, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to discover knowledgeable brain regions in the MRI scans. The knowledgeable regions are those areas of the brain which the 3D-CNN has mostly used to extract important and discriminative features from them. For applying GA on the brain MRI scans, a new chromosome encoding approach is proposed. The proposed framework has been evaluated using ADNI (including 140 subjects for Alzheimer's disease classification) and ABIDE (including 1000 subjects for Autism classification) brain MRI datasets. Experimental results show a 5-fold classification accuracy of 0.85 for the ADNI dataset and 0.70 for the ABIDE dataset. The proposed GABM method has extracted 6 to 65 knowledgeable brain regions in ADNI dataset (and 15 to 75 knowledgeable brain regions in ABIDE dataset). These regions are interpreted as the segments of the brain which are mostly used by the 3D-CNN to extract features for brain disease classification. Experimental results show that besides the model interpretability, the proposed GABM method has increased final performance of the classification model in some cases with respect to model parameters.",0.52748144,0.5097973,0.5136921,0.49867487,0.48116216,0.41461095,0.4483174,0.4368288,0.46938238,0.54885846,0.51864016,0.5212087,0.5728684,0.5566054,Brain MRI analysis using a deep learning based evolutionary approach,6/1/2020,,Hossein Shahamat; Mohammad Saniee Abadeh,Neural Networks,66,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85082848893&origin=inward,,,,218-234,2020,"@article{,

However, this more desirable measure of disease-related alterations is not fully evaluated in early dementia. The study presented here is the first to report the spatial patterns of cortical thickness in the pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, namely mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cortical thickness measurements for 34 healthy elderly, 62 MCI and 42 Alzheimer's disease subjects were made using fully automated magnetic resonance imaging-based analysis techniques in order to determine the pattern of cortical thinning as a function of disease progression. The thickness of the cortex decreased significantly when the healthy elderly brains were compared to those with MCI, mainly in the medial temporal lobe region and in some regions of the frontal and the parietal cortices. With the progression of disease from MCI to Alzheimer's disease, a general thinning of the entire cortex with significant extension into the lateral temporal lobe was found. In all cases, the results were more pronounced in the left hemisphere. In conclusion, we have shown that there is a specific pattern in the thinning of the cortical ribbon which is in agreement with the previous histological reports.

The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate an index based on morphometric measures derived from MRI data that could be used for classification of AD and healthy control subjects, as well as prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Patients originated from the AddNeuroMed project at baseline (119 AD, 119 MCI, 110 controls (CTL)) and 1-year follow-up (62 AD, 73 MCI, 79 CTL). Data consisted of 3D T1-weighted MR images, demographics, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, CERAD and CDR scores, and APOE e4 status. We computed an index using a multivariate classification model (AD vs. CTL), using orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS). Sensitivity, specificity and AUC were determined. Performance of the classifier (AD vs. CTL) was high at baseline (10-fold cross-validation, 84% sensitivity, 91% specificity, 0.93 AUC) and at 1-year follow-up (92% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 0.93 AUC). Predictions of conversion from MCI to AD were good at baseline (77% of MCI converters) and at follow-up (91% of MCI converters). MCI carriers of the APOE e4 allele manifested more atrophy and presented a faster cognitive decline when compared to non-carriers. The derived index demonstrated a steady increase in atrophy over time, yielding higher accuracy in prediction at the time of clinical conversion. Neuropsychological tests appeared less sensitive to changes over time. However, taking the average of the two time points yielded better correlation between the index and cognitive scores as opposed to using cross-sectional data only. Thus, multivariate classification seemed to detect patterns of AD changes before conversion from MCI to AD and including longitudinal information is of great importance. © 2014 Aguilar, Muehlboeck, Mecocci, Vellas, Tsolaki, Kloszewska, Soininen, Lovestone, Wahlund, Simmons and Westman.

This process occurs while individuals are still cognitively normal. Biomarkers of brain β-amyloidosis are reductions in CSF Aβ42 and increased amyloid PET tracer retention. After a lag period, which varies from patient to patient, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the dominant pathological processes. Biomarkers of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration are increased CSF tau and structural MRI measures of cerebral atrophy. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction, which is indicated by decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET.

To address this challenge, we propose a new MCI detection framework based on multi-atlas multi-view hybrid graph convolutional networks and ensemble learning. We first construct nine different graphs based on three brain atlases and three morphological measurements using both imaging and non-imaging data of each subject. Then, in order to integrate the information of different graphs and obtain more discriminative feature representations for detecting MCI, we propose a hybrid graph convolutional network method. Finally, a new ensemble learning method is proposed to perform MCI detection tasks. An evaluation of our proposed framework has been conducted with 369 subjects with cognitively normal (CN), 779 subjects with MCI including 310 subjects with EMCI and 469 subjects with LMCI, and 301 subjects with AD on three classification tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed framework can get an accuracy of 90.8% and an AUC of 0.932 for MCI/CN classification, an accuracy of 88.6% and an AUC of 0.908 for MCI/AD classification, and an accuracy of 83.5% and an AUC of 0.851 for EMCI/LMCI classification, respectively.

This study compares the performances of three classification methods based on support vector machines (SVMs), using as initial sets of brain voxels (ie, features): (1) the segmented grey matter (GM); (2) regions of interest (ROIs) by voxel-wise t-test filtering; (3) parceled ROIs, according to prior knowledge. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) is applied in all cases to investigate whether feature reduction improves the classification accuracy. We analyzed more than 600 AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects, training the SVMs on the AD/CTRL dataset, and evaluating them on a trial MCI dataset. The classification performance, evaluated as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), reaches AUC = (88.9 ± .5)% in 20-fold cross-validation on the AD/CTRL dataset, when the GM is classified as a whole. The highest discrimination accuracy between MCI converters and nonconverters is achieved when the SVM-RFE is applied to the whole GM: with AUC reaching (70.7 ± .9)%, it outperforms both ROI-based approaches in predicting the AD conversion.",0.5484688,0.57796943,0.5788377,0.54946554,0.5565995,0.47088563,0.53151363,0.52329004,0.58573437,0.56441486,0.55924755,0.5237256,0.560875,0.63630825,Predictive Models Based on Support Vector Machines: Whole-Brain versus Regional Analysis of Structural MRI in the Alzheimer's Disease,7/1/2015,,Alessandra Retico; Paolo Bosco; Piergiorgio Cerello; Elisa Fiorina; Andrea Chincarini; Maria Evelina Fantacci,Journal of Neuroimaging,38,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84937073920&origin=inward,,,,552-563,2015,"@article{,

Deep learning with brain imaging is the imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, it is also well known that DCNNs are “black boxes” owing to their low interpretability to humans. The lack of transparency of deep learning compromises its application to the prediction and mechanism investigation in AD. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel general framework that integrates deep leaning, feature selection, causal inference, and genetic-imaging data analysis for predicting and understanding AD. The proposed algorithm not only improves the prediction accuracy but also identifies the brain regions underlying the development of AD and causal paths from genetic variants to AD via image mediation. The proposed algorithm is applied to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 151 subjects (51 AD and 100 non-AD) who were measured at four time points of baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.

In this paper we proposed a new deep learning based automated method for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

However, DL models in medical imaging are often trained on public research cohorts with images acquired with a single scanner or with strict protocol harmonization, which is not representative of a clinical setting. The aim of this study was to investigate how well a DL model performs in unseen clinical datasets–collected with different scanners, protocols and disease populations–and whether more heterogeneous training data improves generalization. In total, 3117 MRI scans of brains from multiple dementia research cohorts and memory clinics, that had been visually rated by a neuroradiologist according to Scheltens’ scale of medial temporal atrophy (MTA), were included in this study. By training multiple versions of a convolutional neural network on different subsets of this data to predict MTA ratings, we assessed the impact of including images from a wider distribution during training had on performance in external memory clinic data. Our results showed that our model generalized well to datasets acquired with similar protocols as the training data, but substantially worse in clinical cohorts with visibly different tissue contrasts in the images. This implies that future DL studies investigating performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) MRI data need to assess multiple external cohorts for reliable results. Further, by including data from a wider range of scanners and protocols the performance improved in OOD data, which suggests that more heterogeneous training data makes the model generalize better. To conclude, this is the most comprehensive study to date investigating the domain shift in deep learning on MRI data, and we advocate rigorous evaluation of DL models on clinical data prior to being certified for deployment.",0.50105506,0.57469195,0.53695196,0.6019951,0.61615485,0.5602442,0.54084504,0.52211803,0.50410086,0.5359497,0.5845351,0.57170826,0.5428945,0.544722,The reliability of a deep learning model in clinical out-of-distribution MRI data: A multicohort study,12/1/2020,,Gustav Mårtensson; Daniel Ferreira; Tobias Granberg; Lena Cavallin; Ketil Oppedal; Alessandro Padovani; Irena Rektorova; Laura Bonanni; Matteo Pardini; Milica G.

Transfer learning methods have demonstrated strong performance in tackling annotated data. It utilizes and transfers knowledge learned from a source domain to target domain even when the dataset is small. There are multiple approaches to transfer learning that result in a range of performance estimates in diagnosis, detection, and classification of clinical problems. Therefore, in this paper, we reviewed transfer learning approaches, their design attributes, and their applications to neuroimaging problems. We reviewed two main literature databases and included the most relevant studies using predefined inclusion criteria. Among 50 reviewed studies, more than half of them are on transfer learning for Alzheimer's disease. Brain mapping and brain tumor detection were second and third most discussed research problems, respectively. The most common source dataset for transfer learning was ImageNet, which is not a neuroimaging dataset. This suggests that the majority of studies preferred pre-trained models instead of training their own model on a neuroimaging dataset. Although, about one third of studies designed their own architecture, most studies used existing Convolutional Neural Network architectures. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was the most common imaging modality. In almost all studies, transfer learning contributed to better performance in diagnosis, classification, segmentation of different neuroimaging diseases and problems, than methods without transfer learning.

Recently, 2D-slice-based models have received increasing attention as they have fewer parameters and may require fewer samples to achieve comparable performance. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for BrainAGE prediction. The proposed architecture works by encoding each 2D slice in an MRI with a deep 2D-CNN model. Next, it combines the information from these 2D-slice encodings using set networks or permutation invariant layers.

We leverage this characteristic of deep learning and present an architecture where multiple information modalities of different complexities can be fused together seamlessly and co-optimized to create a robust classifier.

In particular, MRI-derived brain age has been used as a comprehensive biomarker of brain health that can identify both advanced and resilient ageing individuals via deviations from typical brain ageing. Imaging signatures of various brain diseases, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, have also been identified using machine learning. Prior efforts to derive these indices have been hampered by the need for sophisticated and not easily reproducible processing steps, by insufficiently powered or diversified samples from which typical brain ageing trajectories were derived, and by limited reproducibility across populations and MRI scanners. Herein, we develop and test a sophisticated deep brain network (DeepBrainNet) using a large (n = 11 729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning different studies, scanners, ages and geographic locations around the world. Tests using both cross-validation and a separate replication cohort of 2739 individuals indicate that DeepBrainNet obtains robust brain-age estimates from these diverse datasets without the need for specialized image data preparation and processing. Furthermore, we show evidence that moderately fit brain ageing models may provide brain age estimates that are most discriminant of individuals with pathologies. This is not unexpected as tightly-fitting brain age models naturally produce brain-age estimates that offer little information beyond age, and loosely fitting models may contain a lot of noise. Our results offer some experimental evidence against commonly pursued tightly-fitting models. We show that the moderately fitting brain age models obtain significantly higher differentiation compared to tightly-fitting models in two of the four disease groups tested. Critically, we demonstrate that leveraging DeepBrainNet, along with transfer learning, allows us to construct more accurate classifiers of several brain diseases, compared to directly training classifiers on patient versus healthy control datasets or using common imaging databases such as ImageNet. We, therefore, derive a domain-specific deep network likely to reduce the need for application-specific adaptation and tuning of generic deep learning networks.

The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as—omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.",0.5902635,0.5864366,0.58981675,0.6018565,0.6069741,0.5801559,0.5553699,0.5498473,0.5585496,0.6109517,0.6776823,0.61482763,0.6443981,0.6095225,Deep Learning in Alzheimer's Disease: Diagnostic Classification and Prognostic Prediction Using Neuroimaging Data,8/20/2019,,Taeho Jo; Kwangsik Nho; Andrew J.

However, most existing methods require computationally expensive preprocessing before feature extraction, such as 3D MR image registration and landmark detection. Additionally, these methods only employ cross-sectional MR images. Recent studies have demonstrated that longitudinal images acquired at different time points can comprehensively reflect the pathological changes of diseases. To date, effectively capturing information from variable numbers of longitudinal MR images has not been adequately investigated. In this study, we propose a deep learning method taking advantage of longitudinal MR images for disease diagnoses. In particular, we first extract features from slice images employing a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) in an end-to-end manner. This avoids 3D image registration and landmark detection. We then generate longitudinal-level features by using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. Lastly, we devise a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to capture the pathological changes for facilitating disease diagnoses. We evaluate the proposed method on the public Alzheimer’s Disease National Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is superior to baseline methods and is robust to both the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnoses.

Among them, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are well-known for image-based tasks and have shown excellent performance. In contrast to this remarkable performance, one of their most fundamental drawbacks is their inability to clarify the cause of their outputs. Moreover, each ML algorithm needs to present an explanation of its output to the users to increase its reliability. Occlusion Map is a method used for this purpose and aims to find regions of an image that have a significant impact on determining the network's output, which does this through an iterative process of occluding different regions of images. In this study, we used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and trained a 3D-CNN model to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients from cognitively normal (CN) subjects. We tried to combine a genetic algorithm-based Occlusion Map method with a set of Backpropagation-based explainability methods, and ultimately, we found a brain mask for AD patients. Also, by comparing the extracted brain regions with the studies in this field, we found that the extracted regions are significantly effective in diagnosing AD from the perspective of Alzheimer's specialists. Our model achieved an accuracy of 87% in 5-fold cross-validation, which is an acceptable accuracy compared to similar studies. We considered a 3D-CNN model with 96% validation accuracy (on unmasked data that includes all 96 distinct brain regions of the Harvard-Oxford brain atlas), which we used in the genetic algorithm phase to produce a suitable brain mask.

Unfortunately, the subtle brain alterations captured by these models are difficult to interpret because of the complexity of these multi-layer and non-linear models. Several heatmap methods have been proposed to address this issue and analyze the imaging patterns extracted from the deep neural networks, but no quantitative comparison between these methods has been carried out so far. In this work, we explore these questions by deriving heatmaps from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained using T1 MRI scans of the ADNI data set and by comparing these heatmaps with brain maps corresponding to Support Vector Machine (SVM) activation patterns. Three prominent heatmap methods are studied: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), Integrated Gradients (IG), and Guided Grad-CAM (GGC). Contrary to prior studies where the quality of heatmaps was visually or qualitatively assessed, we obtained precise quantitative measures by computing overlap with a ground-truth map from a large meta-analysis that combined 77 voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies independently from ADNI. Our results indicate that all three heatmap methods were able to capture brain regions covering the meta-analysis map and achieved better results than SVM activation patterns.

However, there are still a few standpoints in terms of diagnosis and planning that can be transformed via quantum Machine Learning (QML). In this study, we present a hybrid classical–quantum machine learning model for the detection of Alzheimer’s using 6400 labeled MRI scans with two classes. Hybrid classical–quantum transfer learning is used, which makes it possible to optimally pre-process complex and high-dimensional data. Classical neural networks extract high-dimensional features and embed informative feature vectors into a quantum processor. We use resnet34 to extract features from the image and feed a 512-feature vector to our quantum variational circuit (QVC) to generate a four-feature vector for precise decision boundaries. Adam optimizer is used to exploit the adaptive learning rate corresponding to each parameter based on first-and second-order gradients. Furthermore, to validate the model, different quantum simulators (PennyLane, qiskit.aer and qiskit.basicaer) are used for the detection of the demented and non-demented images. The learning rate is set to 10−4 for and optimized quantum depth of six layers, resulting in a training accuracy of 99.1% and a classification accuracy of 97.2% for 20 epochs. The hybrid classical–quantum network significantly outperformed the classical network, as the classification accuracy achieved by the classical transfer learning model was 92%. Thus, a hybrid transfer-learning model is used for binary detection, in which a quantum circuit improves the performance of a pre-trained ResNet34 architecture. Therefore, this work offers a method for selecting an optimal approach for detecting Alzheimer’s disease.

Trained deep neural networks need to be generalizable to new data that are not seen before. In practice, there is often insufficient training data available, which can be solved via data augmentation. Nevertheless, there is a lack of augmentation methods to generate data on graphs or surfaces, even though graph convolutional neural network (graph-CNN) has been widely used in deep learning. This study proposed two unbiased augmentation methods, Laplace–Beltrami eigenfunction Data Augmentation (LB-eigDA) and Chebyshev polynomial Data Augmentation (C-pDA), to generate new data on surfaces, whose mean was the same as that of observed data. LB-eigDA augmented data via the resampling of the LB coefficients. In parallel with LB-eigDA, we introduced a fast augmentation approach, C-pDA, that employed a polynomial approximation of LB spectral filters on surfaces. We designed LB spectral bandpass filters by Chebyshev polynomial approximation and resampled signals filtered via these filters in order to generate new data on surfaces. We first validated LB-eigDA and C-pDA via simulated data and demonstrated their use for improving classification accuracy. We then employed brain images of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and extracted cortical thickness that was represented on the cortical surface to illustrate the use of the two augmentation methods. We demonstrated that augmented cortical thickness had a similar pattern to observed data.

As it is practically challenging to capture local and subtle disease-associated abnormalities directly from the whole-brain sMRI, most of those deep-learning approaches empirically preselect disease-associated sMRI brain regions for model construction. Considering that such isolated selection of potentially informative brain locations might be suboptimal, very few methods have been proposed to perform disease-associated discriminative region localization and disease diagnosis in a unified deep-learning framework. However, those methods based on task-oriented discriminative localization still suffer from two common limitations, that is: 1) identified brain locations are strictly consistent across all subjects, which ignores the unique anatomical characteristics of each brain and 2) only limited local regions/patches are used for model training, which does not fully utilize the global structural information provided by the whole-brain sMRI. In this article, we propose an attention-guided deep-learning framework to extract multilevel discriminative sMRI features for dementia diagnosis. Specifically, we first design a backbone fully convolutional network to automatically localize the discriminative brain regions in a weakly supervised manner. Using the identified disease-related regions as spatial attention guidance, we further develop a hybrid network to jointly learn and fuse multilevel sMRI features for CAD model construction.

However, these changes might be subtle particularly in patients with early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI). Hence, developing accurate diagnostic techniques for eMCI identification is critical for early intervention to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a large body of machine-learning-based research developed for classifying different brain states (e.g., AD vs MCI) using neuroimaging data. These works can be fundamentally grouped into two categories. The first one uses correlational methods, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its variants, with the aim to identify most correlated features for diagnosis. The second one includes discriminative methods, such as feature selection methods and linear discriminative analysis (LDA) and its variants to identify brain features that discriminate between two brain states. However, existing methods examine these correlational and discriminative brain data independently, which overlooks the complementary information provided by both techniques, which could prove to be useful in data classification tasks. On the other hand, how early dementia affects cortical brain connections in morphology remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a cooperative correlational and discriminative ensemble learning framework for eMCI diagnosis that leverages a brain network representation from multiple morphological networks, each derived from the cortical surface. Specifically, we devise the shallow convolutional brain multiplex (SCBM), which encodes both region-to-region and network-to-network relationships. Then, we represent each individual brain using a set of SCBMs, which are used to train an ensemble of CCA-SVM and LDA-based classifiers, cooperating to output the label for a new testing subject.

More accurate evaluation of dementia diagnosis can help during the medical examination. Several methods for computer-aided dementia diagnosis have been proposed using resonance imaging scans to discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (NC). Nonetheless, the computer-aided diagnosis is especially challenging because of the heterogeneous and intermediate nature of MCI. We address the automated dementia diagnosis by introducing a novel supervised pretraining approach that takes advantage of the artificial neural network (ANN) for complex classification tasks. The proposal initializes an ANN based on linear projections to achieve more discriminating spaces. Such projections are estimated by maximizing the centered kernel alignment criterion that assesses the affinity between the resonance imaging data kernel matrix and the label target matrix. As a result, the performed linear embedding allows accounting for features that contribute the most to the MCI class discrimination. We compare the supervised pretraining approach to two unsupervised initialization methods (autoencoders and Principal Component Analysis) and against the best four performing classification methods of the 2014 CADDementia challenge.

Presently, 46.8 million people affected with dementia worldwide, and it may increase to 130 million by 2050. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The cost of care for AD patients in 2015 was 818 billion US dollars and is expected to increase intensely due to the increasing number of patients due to the aging society. It isn’t easy to cure AD, but early detection is crucial. This paper proposes a multi-class classification of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC) subjects using three dimensional-convolutional neural network with Support Vector Machine classifier. A cross-sectional study on structural MRI data of 465 subjects, including 132 AD patients, 181 MCI, and 152 NC, is performed in this paper. The highly complex and spatial atrophy patterns of the brain related to Alzheimer’s Disease and MCI are extracted from structural MRI images using cascaded layers of the three dimensional convolutional neural network. The hectic process of segmentation and further extraction of handcrafted features is eliminated. The complete image is considered for the processing, thus incorporating every region of the brain for the classification. The features extracted using four cascaded layers of three dimensional-convolutional neural network are fed into the Support Vector Machine classifier.

The proposed detection of early onset of dementia, also referred to as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is also studied with the help of a novel GAN-augmented dataset.

The ability to distinguish between different dementia and non-dementia early in course may be essential for successful patient care. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may aid as a noninvasive method to increase prediction accuracy. In this work we explored the use of two different 3D local binary pattern (LBP) texture features extracted from T1 MR images of the brain combined with a random forest classifier in an attempt to discern patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and normal controls (NC). Analysis were conducted in areas with white matter lesions (WML) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). We also calculated correlations between texture features and cognition measured by mini mental state examination (MMSE) controlling for age. Additionally, two different methods for handling the imbalanced data problem were tested, namely cost-sensitive classification and resampling of the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Four different classification tasks were extensively tested, a three-class problem: AD vs. LBD vs. NC, a two-class problem: NC vs. AD, a two-class problem NC vs. LBD, and a two-class problem: AD vs. LBD. Results from 10 folds nested cross validation are reported as mean accuracy, precision, and recall with standard deviation in brackets. The two-class problems NC vs. AD and NC vs. LBD, show encouraging results with total accuracy of 0.97 (0.07) and 0.97 (0.06) respectively. The three-class problem and the two-class problem AD vs. LBD are not equally encouraging but shows higher accuracy than clinical diagnosis with a total accuracy of 0.79 (0.07) and 0.79 (0.15) respectively. Possible explanations may be that the AD- and LBD group are too similar concerning LBP texture analysis and that the LBD group is too small. Most of the texture features calculated for the AD subjects in the NAWM region were significantly correlated with cognition. Together with the positive classification results from the NAWM region this may suggest that the NAWM region is an important area for studying AD.

Brain connectivity networks inferred from medical imaging data have been commonly used to distinguish MCI patients from normal controls (NC). However, existing methods still suffer from limited performance, and classification remains mainly based on single modality data. This paper proposes a new model to automatically diagnosing MCI (early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI)) and its earlier stages (i.e., significant memory concern (SMC)) by combining low-rank self-calibrated functional brain networks and structural brain networks for joint multi-task learning. Specifically, we first develop a new functional brain network estimation method. We introduce data quality indicators for self-calibration, which can improve data quality while completing brain network estimation, and perform correlation analysis combined with low-rank structure. Second, functional and structural connected neuroimaging patterns are integrated into our multi-task learning model to select discriminative and informative features for fine MCI analysis. Different modalities are best suited to undertake distinct classification tasks, and similarities and differences among multiple tasks are best determined through joint learning to determine most discriminative features. The learning process is completed by non-convex regularizer, which effectively reduces the penalty bias of trace norm and approximates the original rank minimization problem. Finally, the most relevant disease features classified using a support vector machine (SVM) for MCI identification.

However, deep learning techniques possess the capability of extracting relevant representations from data. In this work, we designed a novel spiking deep convolutional neural network-based pipeline to classify AD using MRI scans. We considered three MRI scan groups (patients with AD dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (NC)). We developed a three-binary classification task (AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and NC vs. MCI) for the AD classification tasks. Specifically, an unsupervised convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is pre-trained on the MRI scans. Finally, a supervised deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the output of the SNN for the classification tasks. Experiments are performed using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and promising results are obtained for the AD classification tasks. We present our proposed model results for both the unsupervised spike pre-training technique and the case where the pre-training technique was not considered, thus serving as a baseline. The accuracy of the proposed model with spike pre-training techniques for the three-binary classification are 90.15%, 87.30%, and 83.90%, respectively, and the accuracy of the model without the spike are 86.90%, 83.25%, and 76.70%, respectively, with a noticeable increase in accuracy and thus, reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also evaluated the robustness of our proposed approach by running experiment on six baseline methods using our preprocessed MRI scans.

Using radiomics analysis, we aimed to determine whether the features extracted from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as potential biomarkers. This study was part of the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline project (NCT03370744), a prospective cohort study. All participants were cognitively healthy at baseline. Cohort 1 (n = 183) was divided into individuals with preclinical AD (n = 78) and controls (n = 105) using amyloid-positron emission tomography, and this cohort was used as the training dataset (80%) and validation dataset (the remaining 20%); cohort 2 (n = 51) was selected retrospectively and divided into “converters” and “nonconverters” according to individuals’ future cognitive status, and this cohort was used as a separate test dataset; cohort three included 37 converters (13 from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and was used as another test set for independent longitudinal research. We extracted radiomics features from multiparametric MRI scans from each participant, using t-tests, autocorrelation tests, and three independent selection algorithms. We then established two classification models (support vector machine [SVM] and random forest [RF]) to verify the efficiency of the retained features. Five-fold cross-validation and 100 repetitions were carried out for the above process. Furthermore, the acquired stable high-frequency features were tested in cohort three by paired two-sample t-tests and survival analyses to identify whether their levels changed with cognitive decline and impact conversion time. The SVM and RF models both showed excellent classification efficiency, with an average accuracy of 89.7–95.9% and 87.1–90.8% in the validation set and 81.9–89.1% and 83.2–83.7% in the test set, respectively. Three stable high-frequency features were identified, all based on the structural MRI modality: the large zone high-gray-level emphasis feature of the right posterior cingulate gyrus, the variance feature of the left superior parietal gyrus, and the coarseness feature of the left posterior cingulate gyrus; their levels were correlated with amyloid-β deposition and predicted future cognitive decline (areas under the curve 0.649–0.761). In addition, levels of the variance feature at baseline decreased with cognitive decline and could affect the conversion time (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this exploratory study shows that the radiomics features of multiparametric MRI scans could represent potential biomarkers of preclinical AD.",0.48459098,0.5398326,0.53391916,0.5856901,0.5338076,0.50379527,0.47578794,0.46886277,0.51395833,0.4974156,0.5455719,0.5334546,0.5029551,0.5200057,Radiomics Analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Facilitates the Identification of Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease: An Exploratory Study,12/3/2020,,Tao Ran Li; Yue Wu; Juan Juan Jiang; Hua Lin; Chun Lei Han; Jie Hui Jiang; Ying Han,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85097769805&origin=inward,,,,,2020,"@article{,

We describe and test a machine learning approach for personalized and cost-effective diagnosis of AD. It uses locally weighted learning to tailor a classifier model to each patient and computes the sequence of biomarkers most informative or cost-effective to diagnose patients. Using ADNI data, we classified AD versus controls and MCI patients who progressed to AD within a year, against those who did not. The approach performed similarly to considering all data at once, while significantly reducing the number (and cost) of the biomarkers needed to achieve a confident diagnosis for each patient.

The results of the tests and the values of biomarkers are dependent on the nuisance features, such as age and gender. In order to improve diagnostic power, the effects of the nuisance features have to be removed from the data. In this paper, four types of interactions between classification features and nuisance features were identified. Three methods were tested to remove these interactions from the classification data. In stratified analysis, a homogeneous subgroup was generated from a training set. Data correction method utilized linear regression model to remove the effects of nuisance features from data. The third method was a combination of these two methods. The methods were tested using all the baseline data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database in two classification studies: classifying control subjects from Alzheimer's disease patients and discriminating stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment subjects. The results show that both stratified analysis and data correction are able to statistically significantly improve the classification accuracy of several neuropsychological tests and imaging biomarkers. The improvements were especially large for the classification of stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment subjects, where the best improvements observed were 6% units. The data correction method gave better results for imaging biomarkers, whereas stratified analysis worked well with the neuropsychological tests. In conclusion, the study shows that the excess variability caused by nuisance features should be removed from the data to improve the classification accuracy, and therefore, the reliability of diagnosis making. © 2012 Koikkalainen et al.",0.5036574,0.514691,0.5602756,0.523642,0.4961015,0.45786232,0.47495756,0.45398375,0.5723957,0.4976913,0.5424845,0.53835404,0.479073,0.49277183,Improved classification of alzheimer's disease data via removal of nuisance variability,2/13/2012,,Juha Koikkalainen; Harri Pölönen; Jussi Mattila; Mark van Gils; Hilkka Soininen; Jyrki Lötjönen,PLoS ONE,44,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84856829701&origin=inward,,,,,2012,"@article{,

This study focuses on integrating multiple imaging modalities to identify individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI, often an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is difficult to diagnose due to its very mild or insignificant symptoms of cognitive impairment. Recent emergence of brain network analysis has made characterization of neurological disorders at a whole-brain connectivity level possible, thus providing new avenues for brain diseases classification. Employing multiple-kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we attempt to integrate information from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for improving classification performance. Our results indicate that the multimodality classification approach yields statistically significant improvement in accuracy over using each modality independently. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed method is 96.3%, which is an increase of at least 7.4% from the single modality-based methods and the direct data fusion method. A cross-validation estimation of the generalization performance gives an area of 0.953 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, indicating excellent diagnostic power. The multimodality classification approach hence allows more accurate early detection of brain abnormalities with greater sensitivity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0.53702813,0.6236152,0.65943056,0.6654261,0.51531756,0.44037324,0.45366696,0.4431646,0.52901804,0.5420598,0.5175272,0.4973304,0.5224121,0.5866926,Identification of MCI individuals using structural and functional connectivity networks,2/1/2012,,Chong Yaw Wee; Pew Thian Yap; Daoqiang Zhang; Kevin Denny; Jeffrey N.

Therefore, it is possible to develop a more effective and accurate AD/MCI automatic diagnosis method by integrating complementary information of different modalities. In this paper, we propose multi-modal sparse hierarchical extreme leaning machine (MSH-ELM). We used volume and mean intensity extracted from 93 regions of interest (ROIs) as features of MRI and FDG-PET, respectively, and used p-tau, t-tau, and Aβ42 as CSF features. In detail, high-level representation was individually extracted from each of MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF using a stacked sparse extreme learning machine auto-encoder (sELM-AE). Then, another stacked sELM-AE was devised to acquire a joint hierarchical feature representation by fusing the high-level representations obtained from each modality. Finally, we classified joint hierarchical feature representation using a kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM). The results of MSH-ELM were compared with those of conventional ELM, single kernel support vector machine (SK-SVM), multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) and stacked auto-encoder (SAE). Performance was evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation. In the classification of AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC problem, the proposed MSH-ELM method showed mean balanced accuracies of 96.10% and 86.46%, respectively, which is much better than those of competing methods. In summary, the proposed algorithm exhibits consistently better performance than SK-SVM, ELM, MK-SVM and SAE in the two binary classification problems (AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC).",0.53375924,0.62473905,0.6538974,0.66337746,0.5209594,0.47421107,0.5048036,0.50863814,0.5365312,0.5681814,0.5387801,0.5062926,0.55295235,0.6048019,Identification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment using multimodal sparse hierarchical extreme learning machine,9/1/2018,,Jongin Kim; Boreom Lee,Human Brain Mapping,43,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046487564&origin=inward,,,,3728-3741,2018,"@article{,

The early detection and the stratification of patients according to the underlying disease are essential for an efficient approach to this healthcare challenge. This emphasizes the importance of differential diagnostics. Most studies compare patients and controls, or Alzheimer's disease with one other type of dementia. Such a bilateral comparison does not resemble clinical practice, where a clinician is faced with a number of different possible types of dementia. Here we studied which features in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans could best distinguish four types of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, and control subjects. We extracted an extensive set of features quantifying volumetric and morphometric characteristics from T1 images, and vascular characteristics from FLAIR images. Classification was performed using a multi-class classifier based on Disease State Index methodology. The classifier provided continuous probability indices for each disease to support clinical decision making. A dataset of 504 individuals was used for evaluation. The cross-validated classification accuracy was 70.6% and balanced accuracy was 69.1% for the five disease groups using only automatically determined MRI features. Vascular dementia patients could be detected with high sensitivity (96%) using features from FLAIR images. Controls (sensitivity 82%) and Alzheimer's disease patients (sensitivity 74%) could be accurately classified using T1-based features, whereas the most difficult group was the dementia with Lewy bodies (sensitivity 32%). These results were notable better than the classification accuracies obtained with visual MRI ratings (accuracy 44.6%, balanced accuracy 51.6%). Different quantification methods provided complementary information, and consequently, the best results were obtained by utilizing several quantification methods. The results prove that automatic quantification methods and computerized decision support methods are feasible for clinical practice and provide comprehensive information that may help clinicians in the diagnosis making.",0.5320529,0.5432668,0.56310564,0.56473523,0.5147592,0.50321424,0.46648774,0.45947266,0.55200374,0.5355124,0.529948,0.5018153,0.5356935,0.59503853,Differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases using structural MRI data,1/1/2016,,Juha Koikkalainen; Hanneke Rhodius-Meester; Antti Tolonen; Frederik Barkhof; Betty Tijms; Afina W.

The use of DTI as a biomarker, however, depends on its applicability in a multicenter setting accounting for effects of different MRI scanners. We applied multivariate machine learning (ML) to a large multicenter sample from the recently created framework of the European DTI study on Dementia (EDSD). We hypothesized that ML approaches may amend effects of multicenter acquisition. We included a sample of 137 patients with clinically probable AD (MMSE 20.6±5.3) and 143 healthy elderly controls, scanned in nine different scanners. For diagnostic classification we used the DTI indices fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) and, for comparison, gray matter and white matter density maps from anatomical MRI. Data were classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier. We used two cross-validation approaches, (i) test and training samples randomly drawn from the entire data set (pooled cross-validation) and (ii) data from each scanner as test set, and the data from the remaining scanners as training set (scanner-specific cross-validation). In the pooled cross-validation, SVM achieved an accuracy of 80% for FA and 83% for MD. Accuracies for NB were significantly lower, ranging between 68% and 75%. Removing variance components arising from scanners using principal component analysis did not significantly change the classification results for both classifiers. For the scanner-specific cross-validation, the classification accuracy was reduced for both SVM and NB. After mean correction, classification accuracy reached a level comparable to the results obtained from the pooled cross-validation. Our findings support the notion that machine learning classification allows robust classification of DTI data sets arising from multiple scanners, even if a new data set comes from a scanner that was not part of the training sample. © 2013 Dyrba et al.",0.4842789,0.547608,0.55975145,0.57209235,0.54706544,0.4881434,0.51791006,0.49982578,0.5263859,0.49828857,0.5299777,0.50152636,0.499716,0.5713001,Robust Automated Detection of Microstructural White Matter Degeneration in Alzheimer's Disease Using Machine Learning Classification of Multicenter DTI Data,5/31/2013,,Martin Dyrba; Michael Ewers; Martin Wegrzyn; Ingo Kilimann; Claudia Plant; Annahita Oswald; Thomas Meindl; Michela Pievani; Arun L.W.

Therefore, it is of great interest to determine which biomarkers should be combined to accurately predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia. However, up to date, only few studies performed a complete A/T/N subject characterization using each of the CSF and imaging markers, or they only investigated long-term (≥ 2 years) prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amyloid- and 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) measures at baseline, in relation to cognitive changes and conversion to AD dementia over a short-term (12-month) period. We included 13 healthy controls, 49 MCI and 16 AD dementia patients with a clinical-based diagnosis and a complete A/T/N characterization at baseline. Global cortical amyloid-β (Aβ) burden was quantified using the 18 F-AV45 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) with two different reference regions (cerebellar grey and subcortical white matter), whereas metabolism was assessed based on 18 F-FDG SUVR. CSF measures included Aβ 1–42 , Aβ 1–40 , T-tau, P-tau 181 , and their ratios, and MRI markers included hippocampal volumes (HV), white matter hyperintensities, and cortical grey matter volumes. Cognitive functioning was measured by MMSE and RBANS index scores. All statistical analyses were corrected for age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 genotype. As a result, faster cognitive decline was most strongly associated with hypometabolism (posterior cingulate) and smaller hippocampal volume (e.g., Δstory recall: β = +0.43 [p < 0.001] and + 0.37 [p = 0.005], resp.) at baseline. In addition, faster cognitive decline was significantly associated with higher baseline Aβ burden only if SUVR was referenced to the subcortical white matter (e.g., Δstory recall: β = −0.28 [p = 0.020]). Patients with MCI converted to AD dementia at an annual rate of 31%, which could be best predicted by combining neuropsychological testing (visuospatial construction skills) with either MRI-based HV or 18 F-FDG-PET. Combining all three markers resulted in 96% specificity and 92% sensitivity.

Six dementia experts with variable FDG-PET experience made independent, forced choice, diagnostic decisions in 45 patients with pathologically confirmed AD (n = 31) or FTD (n = 14) using five separate methods: (1) review of clinical summaries, (2) a diagnostic checklist alone, (3) summary and checklist, (4) transaxial FDG-PET scans and (5) FDG-PET stereotactic surface projection (SSP) metabolic and statistical maps. In addition, we evaluated the effect of the sequential review of a clinical summary followed by SSP. Visual interpretation of SSP images was superior to clinical assessment and had the best inter-rater reliability (mean kappa = 0.78) and diagnostic accuracy (89.6%). It also had the highest specificity (97.6%) and sensitivity (86%), and positive likelihood ratio for FTD (36.5). The addition of FDG-PET to clinical summaries increased diagnostic accuracy and confidence for both AD and FTD. It was particularly helpful when raters were uncertain in their clinical diagnosis. Visual interpretation of FDG-PET after brief training is more reliable and accurate in distinguishing FTD from AD than clinical methods alone. FDG-PET adds important information that appropriately increases diagnostic confidence, even among experienced dementia specialists. © The Author (2007).

In this paper, we propose a pMCI/sMCI classification framework that harnesses information available in longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which could be incomplete, to improve diagnostic accuracy. Volumetric features were first extracted from the baseline MRI scan and subsequent scans acquired after 6, 12, and 18 months. Dynamic features were then obtained using the 18th month scan as the reference and computing the ratios of feature differences for the earlier scans. Features that are linearly or non-linearly correlated with diagnostic labels are then selected using two elastic net sparse learning algorithms. Missing feature values due to the incomplete longitudinal data are imputed using a low-rank matrix completion method. Finally, based on the completed feature matrix, we build a multi-kernel support vector machine (mkSVM) to predict the diagnostic label of samples with unknown diagnostic statuses. Our evaluation indicates that a diagnosis accuracy as high as 78.2 % can be achieved when information from the longitudinal scans is used—6.6 % higher than the case using only the reference time point image.

In this study, we investigate the extent to which this task-related dichotomy is represented intrinsically in the resting human brain through examination of spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal. We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function.

The focus of most of these studies has relied upon the detection of AD from neu-roimaging data. However, recognizing symptoms early as much as possible(Pre-detection) is crucial as disease modifying drugs will be most effective if administered early in the course of disease, before the occurrence of irreversible brain damages. Therefore, there is a high importance of utilizing automated techniques for the purpose of pre-detection of AD symptoms from such data. We report an experimental approach to evaluate the best pre-detection method of AD. Our study consists of two main experiments. Those two experiments were implemented using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Prior to our first experiment we have stated an assumption which is, if there is a successful AD detection method that will be successful in AD pre-detection also. Different studies have used different data sets and different diagnosing methods. Therefore we have verified the existing and the most successful detection method which is Support Vector Machine (SVMs) as the first experiment. According to the results obtained from the initial experiment (detection study) the sensitivity is 95.3%, the specificity is 71.4% and the accuracy is 84.4% with use of a SVM. Since those results were not successful, a deep learning based technique (Convolutional Neural Network) was proposed as the second experiment. The proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was being tested using different image segmentation methods and different datasets. Finally the best image segmentation method obtained a high accuracy around 96% (sensitivity - 96%, specificity - 98%). And the CNN model remains unbiased to the dataset.

As a result, various research for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease was conducted. However, these techniques have a number of drawbacks, including higher computational costs, failure to incorporate data from multiple modalities, performance degradation due to data distributions between training and testing data, inability to record brain affected regions, longer processing time, etc. To tackle these issues, we proposed Optimized VGG-16 architecture using Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (Optimized VGG-16 using AOA) for AD classification. Three major components are involved in this study such as pre-processing, segmentation, and classification. The CAT12 toolkit is used to process the format of T1-weighted MRI images during pre-processing. The image enhancement techniques normalize the uneven light distribution in which the linear contrast stretching enhances the image contrast level.

Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject’s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.",0.54246795,0.6632036,0.5959302,0.5952479,0.561314,0.53538346,0.50926805,0.50744975,0.52892286,0.59931195,0.5904001,0.54508936,0.6288218,0.60094774,Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Novel Approach Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning,5/13/2020,,Dan Pan; An Zeng; Longfei Jia; Yin Huang; Tory Frizzell; Xiaowei Song,Frontiers in Neuroscience,174,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85085490397&origin=inward,,,,,2020,"@article{,

Thus, specialists can begin preventive treatment as soon as possible. They demand fast and precise assessment in the diagnosis of AD in the earliest and hardest to detect stages. The main objective of this work is to develop a system that automatically detects the presence of the disease in sagittal magnetic resonance images (MRI), which are not generally used. Sagittal MRIs from ADNI and OASIS data sets were employed. Experiments were conducted using Transfer Learning (TL) techniques in order to achieve more accurate results. There are two main conclusions to be drawn from this work: first, the damages related to AD and its stages can be distinguished in sagittal MRI and, second, the results obtained using DL models with sagittal MRIs are similar to the state-of-the-art, which uses the horizontal-plane MRI. Although sagittal-plane MRIs are not commonly used, this work proved that they were, at least, as effective as MRI from other planes at identifying AD in early stages. This could pave the way for further research. Finally, one should bear in mind that in certain fields, obtaining the examples for a data set can be very expensive.

Neuroimaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have the potential to detect brain changes before symptoms emerge. Structural MRI can detect atrophy related to AD, but it is possible that functional changes are observed even earlier. We therefore examined the potential of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to detect differences in functional brain activity in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) – a state at risk of early AD. We introduce a framework for multimodal combination to ask whether MEG data from a resting-state provides complementary information beyond structural MRI data in the classification of MCI versus controls. More specifically, we used multi-kernel learning of support vector machines to classify 163 MCI cases versus 144 healthy elderly controls from the BioFIND dataset. When using the covariance of planar gradiometer data in the low Gamma range (30–48 Hz), we found that adding a MEG kernel improved classification accuracy above kernels that captured several potential confounds (e.g., age, education, time-of-day, head motion). However, accuracy using MEG alone (68%) was worse than MRI alone (71%). When simply concatenating (normalized) features from MEG and MRI into one kernel (Early combination), there was no advantage of combining MEG with MRI versus MRI alone. When combining kernels of modality-specific features (Intermediate combination), there was an improvement in multimodal classification to 74%. The biggest multimodal improvement however occurred when we combined kernels from the predictions of modality-specific classifiers (Late combination), which achieved 77% accuracy (a reliable improvement in terms of permutation testing). We also explored other MEG features, such as the variance versus covariance of magnetometer versus planar gradiometer data within each of 6 frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, low gamma, or high gamma), and found that they generally provided complementary information for classification above MRI. We conclude that MEG can improve on the MRI-based classification of MCI.",0.5153583,0.5912268,0.6132498,0.6599794,0.50044197,0.4305024,0.47053128,0.45574725,0.5440842,0.5448018,0.53715134,0.5057899,0.5404653,0.5438051,Late combination shows that MEG adds to MRI in classifying MCI versus controls,5/15/2022,,Delshad Vaghari; Ehsanollah Kabir; Richard N.

Despite significant advances in diagnostic methods for AD, there is no single diagnostic method for AD with high accuracy. We developed a support vector machine (SVM) model that classifies mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal control subjects using probabilistic tractography and tract-based spatial statistics of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. MCI is an intermediate state between normal aging and AD, so finding MCI is important for an early diagnosis of AD. The key features of DTI data we identified through extensive analysis include the fractional anisotropy (FA) values of selected voxels, their average FA value, and the volume of fiber pathways from a pre-defined seed region. In particular, the volume of the fiber pathways to thalamus is the most powerful single feature in classifying MCI and normal subjects regardless of the age of the subjects.

However, brain degeneration in MCI evolves with time and differs from patient to patient, making early diagnosis a very challenging task. Despite these difficulties, many machine learning techniques have already been used for the diagnosis of MCI and for predicting MCI to AD conversion, but the MCI group used in previous works is usually very heterogeneous containing subjects at different stages. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the disease stage impacts on the ability of machine learning methodologies to predict conversion. After identifying the converters and estimating the time of conversion (TC) (using neuropsychological test scores), we devised 5 subgroups of MCI converters (MCI-C) based on their temporal distance to the conversion instant (0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months before conversion). Next, we used the FDG-PET images of these subgroups and trained classifiers to distinguish between the MCI-C at different stages and stable non-converters (MCI-NC). Our results show that MCI to AD conversion can be predicted as early as 24 months prior to conversion and that the discriminative power of the machine learning methods decreases with the increasing temporal distance to the TC, as expected. These findings were consistent for all the tested classifiers. Our results also show that this decrease arises from a reduction in the information contained in the regions used for classification and by a decrease in the stability of the automatic selection procedure.",0.4973121,0.54130113,0.56744224,0.55098593,0.54848987,0.5208795,0.51814926,0.5081824,0.56884587,0.5415996,0.5566809,0.5164584,0.5322194,0.5506319,Predicting conversion from MCI to AD with FDG-PET brain images at different prodromal stages,3/1/2015,,Carlos Cabral; Pedro M.

Besides, AD patients are represented by heterogeneous, yet complementary, multimodalities. Multitask modeling improves progression-detection performance, robustness, and stability. However, multimodal multitask modeling has not been evaluated using time series and deep learning paradigm, especially for AD progression detection. In this paper, we propose a robust ensemble deep learning model based on a stacked convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. This multimodal multitask model jointly predicts multiple variables based on the fusion of five types of multimodal time series data plus a set of background (BG) knowledge. Predicted variables include AD multiclass progression task, and four critical cognitive scores regression tasks. The proposed model extracts local and longitudinal features of each modality using a stacked CNN and BiLSTM network. Concurrently, local features are extracted from the BG data using a feed-forward neural network. Resultant features are fused to a deep network to detect common patterns which jointly used to predict the classification and regression tasks. To validate our model, we performed six experiments on five modalities from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) of 1536 subjects. The results of the proposed approach achieve state-of-the-art performance for both multiclass progression and regression tasks. Moreover, our approach can be generalized in other medial domains to analyze heterogeneous temporal data for predicting patient's future status.",0.4921301,0.61911005,0.6576715,0.62847644,0.5456438,0.53941965,0.5139538,0.50647885,0.517674,0.56898326,0.59632385,0.55468565,0.5705835,0.5529815,Multimodal multitask deep learning model for Alzheimer's disease progression detection based on time series data,10/28/2020,,Shaker El-Sappagh; Tamer Abuhmed; S.

So far, multiple biomarkers have been shown to be sensitive to the diagnosis of AD and MCI, i.e., structural MR imaging (MRI) for brain atrophy measurement, functional imaging (e.g., FDG-PET) for hypometabolism quantification, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for quantification of specific proteins. However, most existing research focuses on only a single modality of biomarkers for diagnosis of AD and MCI, although recent studies have shown that different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of AD and MCI. In this paper, we propose to combine three modalities of biomarkers, i.e., MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF biomarkers, to discriminate between AD (or MCI) and healthy controls, using a kernel combination method. Specifically, ADNI baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data from 51. AD patients, 99 MCI patients (including 43 MCI converters who had converted to AD within 18. months and 56 MCI non-converters who had not converted to AD within 18. months), and 52 healthy controls are used for development and validation of our proposed multimodal classification method. In particular, for each MR or FDG-PET image, 93 volumetric features are extracted from the 93 regions of interest (ROIs), automatically labeled by an atlas warping algorithm. For CSF biomarkers, their original values are directly used as features. Then, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to evaluate the classification accuracy, using a 10-fold cross-validation. As a result, for classifying AD from healthy controls, we achieve a classification accuracy of 93.2% (with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 93.3%) when combining all three modalities of biomarkers, and only 86.5% when using even the best individual modality of biomarkers. Similarly, for classifying MCI from healthy controls, we achieve a classification accuracy of 76.4% (with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 66%) for our combined method, and only 72% even using the best individual modality of biomarkers. Further analysis on MCI sensitivity of our combined method indicates that 91.5% of MCI converters and 73.4% of MCI non-converters are correctly classified. Moreover, we also evaluate the classification performance when employing a feature selection method to select the most discriminative MR and FDG-PET features. Again, our combined method shows considerably better performance, compared to the case of using an individual modality of biomarkers. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0.53018796,0.60490465,0.6664817,0.6835085,0.5173913,0.49390167,0.4979048,0.49242854,0.53949904,0.5750454,0.5201316,0.4971372,0.5503056,0.60015,Multimodal classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment,4/1/2011,,Daoqiang Zhang; Yaping Wang; Luping Zhou; Hong Yuan; Dinggang Shen,NeuroImage,1061,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79952073234&origin=inward,,,,856-867,2011,"@article{,

Although considerable progress has been made, there remain several significant challenges in traditional methods for fusing multi-modality data. First, the fusion of multi-modality data is usually independent of the training of diagnostic models, leading to sub-optimal performance. Second, it is challenging to effectively exploit the complementary information among multiple modalities based on low-level imaging features (e.g., image intensity or tissue volume). To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Latent Multi-modality Dementia Diagnosis (DLMD2) framework based on a deep non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model. Specifically, we integrate the feature fusion/learning process into the classifier construction step for eliminating the gap between neuroimaging features and disease labels. To exploit the correlations among multi-modality data, we learn latent representations for multi-modality data by sharing the common high-level representations in the last layer of each modality in the deep NMF model.

From a signal processing perspective, EEGs yield a nonlinear and nonstationary, multivariate representation of the underlying neural circuitry interactions. In this paper, a novel multi-modal Machine Learning (ML) based approach is proposed to integrate EEG engineered features for automatic classification of brain states. EEGs are acquired from neurological patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the aim is to discriminate Healthy Control (HC) subjects from patients. Specifically, in order to effectively cope with nonstationarities, 19-channels EEG signals are projected into the time–frequency (TF) domain by means of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and a set of appropriate features (denoted as CWT features) are extracted from δ, θ, α1, α2, β EEG sub-bands. Furthermore, to exploit nonlinear phase-coupling information of EEG signals, higher order statistics (HOS) are extracted from the bispectrum (BiS) representation. BiS generates a second set of features (denoted as BiS features) which are also evaluated in the five EEG sub-bands. The CWT and BiS features are fed into a number of ML classifiers to perform both 2-way (AD vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, MCI vs. HC) and 3-way (AD vs. MCI vs. HC) classifications. As an experimental benchmark, a balanced EEG dataset that includes 63 AD, 63 MCI and 63 HC is analyzed. Comparative results show that when the concatenation of CWT and BiS features (denoted as multi-modal (CWT+BiS) features) is used as input, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier outperforms all other models, specifically, the Autoencoder (AE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

With the growing popularity of deep learning technologies, researchers have started to ensemble these technologies for various purposes. Few, if any, however, have used the deep learning approach as a means to ensemble Alzheimer's disease classification algorithms. This paper presents a deep ensemble learning framework that aims to harness deep learning algorithms to integrate multisource data and tap the 'wisdom of experts'. At the voting layer, two sparse autoencoders are trained for feature learning to reduce the correlation of attributes and diversify the base classifiers ultimately. At the stacking layer, a nonlinear feature-weighted method based on a deep belief network is proposed to rank the base classifiers, which may violate the conditional independence. The neural network is used as a meta classifier. At the optimizing layer, over-sampling and threshold-moving are used to cope with the cost-sensitive problem. Optimized predictions are obtained based on an ensemble of probabilistic predictions by similarity calculation. The proposed deep ensemble learning framework is used for Alzheimer's disease classification. Experiments with the clinical dataset from National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center demonstrate that the classification accuracy of our proposed framework is 4% better than six well-known ensemble approaches, including the standard stacking algorithm as well. Adequate coverage of more accurate diagnostic services can be provided by utilizing the wisdom of averaged physicians.

Proper diversity among component classifiers is considered an important parameter for ensemble construction so that failure of one may be compensated by others. Among various approaches, data sampling, i.e., different data sets for different classifiers, is found more effective than other approaches. A number of ensemble methods have been proposed under the umbrella of data sampling in which some are constrained to neural networks or decision trees and others are commonly applicable to both types of classifiers. We studied prominent data sampling techniques for neural network ensembles, and then experimentally evaluated their effectiveness on a common test ground. Based on overlap and uncover, the relation between generalization and diversity is presented. Eight ensemble methods were tested on 30 benchmark classification problems. We found that bagging and boosting, the pioneer ensemble methods, are still better than most of the other proposed methods.

As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated.

Thus, early detection of controls at high risk of development of Alzheimer's disease is of a key objective of the proposed work.

Brain networks provide an important representation of those functional interactions, and thus are widely applied in the diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative diseases. Many mental disorders involve a sharp decline in cognitive ability as a major symptom, which can be caused by abnormal connectivity patterns among several brain regions. However, conventional functional connectivity networks are usually constructed based on pairwise correlations among different brain regions. This approach ignores higher-order relationships, and cannot effectively characterize the high-order interactions of many brain regions working together. Recent neuroscience research suggests that higher-order relationships between brain regions are important for brain network analysis. Hyper-networks have been proposed that can effectively represent the interactions among brain regions. However, this method extracts the local properties of brain regions as features, but ignores the global topology information, which affects the evaluation of network topology and reduces the performance of the classifier. This problem can be compensated by a subgraph feature-based method, but it is not sensitive to change in a single brain region. Considering that both of these feature extraction methods result in the loss of information, we propose a novel machine learning classification method that combines multiple features of a hyper-network based on functional magnetic resonance imaging in Alzheimer's disease. The method combines the brain region features and subgraph features, and then uses a multi-kernel SVM for classification. This retains not only the global topological information, but also the sensitivity to change in a single brain region. To certify the proposed method, 28 normal control subjects and 38 Alzheimer's disease patients were selected to participate in an experiment. The proposed method achieved satisfactory classification accuracy, with an average of 91.60%.

A range of diverse values can be produced by mining ontological approaches for demonstrating disease mechanisms. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable neurological brain illness. An early diagnosis of AD can be helpful for better treatment and the prevention of brain tissue destruction. Researchers have used machine learning techniques to predict the early detection of AD. However, Alzheimer’s disorders are still underexplored in the knowledge domain. In the biomedical field, the illustration of terminologies and notions is essential. Multiple methods are adopted to represent these notions, but ontologies are the most frequent and accurate. Ontology construction is a complex and time-consuming process. The designed ontology relies on Disease Ontology (DO), which is considered the benchmark in medical practice. Ontology reasoning mechanisms can be adopted for AD identification. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network-based approach is proposed to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, using an AD dataset acquired from Kaggle. Machine learning-based approaches (logistic regression, gradient boosting, XGB, SGD, MLP, SVM, KNN, random forest) are also used for a fair comparison. The simulation results are generated using three strategies (default parameters, 10-cross validation, and grid search), and MLP provides superior results on a default parameter strategy with an accuracy of 92.12%. Furthermore, the deep learning-based approach convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved an accuracy of 94.61%.

Therefore, early detection of AD is essential affecting the points of the brain that control vital functions. Various early AD detection approaches have been employed using machine learning. In literature, most of the early detection of AD approaches has been developed using singlemachine learning methods. Due to the importance of early detection of AD, the goal of this study is to improve the classification performance of the previous studies for early detection of AD applying ensemble learning methods including bagging, boosting and stacking. ADNI clinical dataset was used in this study with three target classes: Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed ensemble learning methods provided better classification performance compared to single machine learning methods. Besides, the best classification performance from the ensemble methods is obtained through the boosting (AdaBoost) ensemble (92.7%).

Low-dimensional biomarkers, such as mental status test scores and cerebrospinal fluid level, are essential in clinical diagnosis of neurological disorders, because they could be simple and effective for the clinicians to assess the disorder’s progression and severity. Rather than only using the low-dimensional biomarkers as inputs for decision making systems, we believe that such low-dimensional biomarkers can be used for enhancing the feature learning pipeline. In this study, we proposed a novel feature representation learning framework, Multi-Phase Feature Representation (MPFR), with low-dimensional biomarkers embedded. MPFR learns high-level neuroimaging features by extracting the associations between the low-dimensional biomarkers and the highdimensional neuroimaging features with a deep neural network. We validated the proposed framework using the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (MMSE) scores as a low-dimensional biomarker and multi-modal neuroimaging data as the high-dimensional neuroimaging features from the ADNI baseline cohort.

Combining multi-modal data for classification can better realize the complementarity of valuable information. In order to improve the classification performance of feature selection on multi-modal data, we propose a multi-modal feature selection algorithm using feature correlation and feature structure fusion (FC2FS). First, we construct feature correlation regularization by fusing a similarity matrix between multi-modal feature nodes. Then, based on manifold learning, we employ feature matrix fusion to construct feature structure regularization, and learn the local geometric structure of the feature nodes. Finally, the two regularizations are embedded in a multi-task learning model that introduces low-rank constraint, the multi-modal features are selected, and the final features are linearly fused and input into a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Different controlled experiments were set to verify the validity of the proposed method, which was applied to MCI and AD classification. The accuracy of normal controls versus Alzheimer’s disease, normal controls versus late mild cognitive impairment, normal controls versus early mild cognitive impairment, and early mild cognitive impairment versus late mild cognitive impairment achieve 91.85 ± 1.42%, 85.33 ± 2.22%, 78.29 ± 2.20%, and 77.67 ± 1.65%, respectively. This method makes up for the shortcomings of the traditional multi-modal feature selection based on subjects and fully considers the relationship between feature nodes and the local geometric structure of feature space.

We have examined statistical discrimination procedures to help achieve this purpose and compared the results to visual ratings of FDG-PET images. The methods are applied to a data set of 48 subjects with autopsy confirmed diagnoses of AD or FTD (these subjects come from a multi-centre collaborative study funded by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center). FDG-PET images are composed of thousands of voxels (volume elements) so one is left with a situation where there are vastly more variables than subjects. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a data reduction before a statistical procedure can be applied. Approaches using both the entire image and summary statistics calculated on a number of volumes of interest (VOI) are examined. We performed the data reduction techniques of principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS) on the entire image and then used linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic (QDA) or logistic regression (LR) to classify subjects as having AD or FTD. Some of these methods achieve diagnostic accuracy (as assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation) that is similar to visual ratings by expert raters. Methods using PLS appear to be more successful. Averaging or using VOI data may also be helpful.

Furthermore, it used minimally processed images without spatial normalization which has been commonly used in conventional quantitative analyses. Cognitive outcome of MCI subjects was predicted using this network. The prediction accuracy of the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD was compared with the conventional feature-based quantification approach. Accuracy of prediction (84.2%) for conversion to AD in MCI patients outperformed conventional feature-based quantification approaches. ROC analyses revealed that performance of CNN-based approach was significantly higher than that of the conventional quantification methods (p < 0.05).

Specifically, we first train multiple sparse regression models, each of which has different values of a regularization control parameter, and use the outputs of the trained regression models as target-level representations. Note that sparse regression models trained with different values of a regularization control parameter potentially select different sets of features from the original ones, thereby they have different powers to predict the response values, i.e., a clinical label and clinical scores in our work. We then construct a deep convolutional neural network by taking the target-level representations as input. Our deep network learns to optimally fuse the predicted response variables, i.e., target-level representations, from the same sparse response model(s) and also those from the neighboring sparse response models.

Here, we focus on the problems of both feature representation and fusion of multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature mostly used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined these multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or transforming into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for a high-level latent and shared feature representation from neuroimaging modalities via deep learning. Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). 22Although it is clear from the context that the acronym DBM denotes ""Deep Boltzmann Machine"" in this paper, we would clearly indicate that DBM here is not related to ""Deformation Based Morphometry""., a deep network with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block, to find a latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the paired patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In three binary classification problems of AD vs. healthy Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and MCI converter vs. MCI non-converter, we obtained the maximal accuracies of 95.35%, 85.67%, and 74.58%, respectively, outperforming the competing methods. By visual inspection of the trained model, we observed that the proposed method could hierarchically discover the complex latent patterns inherent in both MRI and PET.",0.5665072,0.6196867,0.6398461,0.6993025,0.5629605,0.49779874,0.51080555,0.51259565,0.5266749,0.58905846,0.5800875,0.56075054,0.57667077,0.615536,Hierarchical feature representation and multimodal fusion with deep learning for AD/MCI diagnosis,11/1/2014,,Heung Il Suk; Seong Whan Lee; Dinggang Shen,NeuroImage,673,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84907019192&origin=inward,,,,569-582,2014,"@article{,

Previous studies suggest that the deep learning (DL) techniques have the potential to solve the differential diagnosis problem of FTD, AD and normal controls (NCs), but its performance is still unclear. In addition, existing DL-assisted diagnostic studies still rely on hypothesis-based expert-level preprocessing. On the one hand, it imposes high requirements on clinicians and data themselves; On the other hand, it hinders the backtracking of classification results to the original image data, resulting in the classification results cannot be interpreted intuitively. In the current study, a large cohort of 3D T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes (n = 4,099) was collected from two publicly available databases, i.e., the ADNI and the NIFD. We trained a DL-based network directly based on raw T1 images to classify FTD, AD and corresponding NCs. And we evaluated the convergence speed, differential diagnosis ability, robustness and generalizability under nine scenarios. The proposed network yielded an accuracy of 91.83% based on the most common T1-weighted sequence [magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE)]. The knowledge learned by the DL network through multiple classification tasks can also be used to solve subproblems, and the knowledge is generalizable and not limited to a specified dataset. Furthermore, we applied a gradient visualization algorithm based on guided backpropagation to calculate the contribution graph, which tells us intuitively why the DL-based networks make each decision. The regions making valuable contributions to FTD were more widespread in the right frontal white matter regions, while the left temporal, bilateral inferior frontal and parahippocampal regions were contributors to the classification of AD. Our results demonstrated that DL-based networks have the ability to solve the enigma of differential diagnosis of diseases without any hypothesis-based preprocessing. Moreover, they may mine the potential patterns that may be different from human clinicians, which may provide new insight into the understanding of FTD and AD.",0.5483147,0.54899096,0.5455574,0.5684119,0.57483065,0.54682326,0.51928395,0.5118992,0.52448213,0.5512913,0.58582014,0.5635642,0.57511985,0.5763856,Deep Learning-Based Classification and Voxel-Based Visualization of Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease,1/21/2021,,Jingjing Hu; Zhao Qing; Renyuan Liu; Xin Zhang; Pin Lv; Maoxue Wang; Yang Wang; Kelei He; Yang Gao; Bing Zhang,Frontiers in Neuroscience,34,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100565604&origin=inward,,,,,2021,"@article{,

Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) can be useful in distinguishing the different patterns of white matter degradation between the two dementias. In this study, we performed MRI scans in a 4 Tesla MRI machine including T1-weighted structural images and diffusion tensor images in 18 patients with FTD, 18 patients with Alzheimers disease and 19 cognitively normal (CN) controls. FA was measured selectively in specific fibre tracts (including corpus callosum, cingulum, uncinate and corticospinal tracts) as well as globally in a voxel-by-voxel analysis. Patients with FTD were associated with reductions of FA in frontal and temporal regions including the anterior corpus callosum (P < 0.001), bilateral anterior (left P < 0.001; right P 0.005), descending (left P < 0.001; right P 0.003) cingulum tracts, and uncinate tracts (left P < 0.001; right P 0.005), compared to controls. Patients with Alzheimers disease were associated with reductions of FA in parietal, temporal and frontal regions including the left anterior (P 0.003) and posterior (P 0.002) cingulum tracts, bilateral descending cingulum tracts (P < 0.001) and left uncinate tracts (P < 0.001) compared to controls. When compared with Alzheimers disease, FTD was associated with greater reductions of FA in frontal brain regions, whereas no region in Alzheimers disease showed greater reductions of FA when compared to FTD. In conclusion, the regional patterns of anisotropy reduction in FTD and Alzheimers disease compared to controls suggest a characteristic distribution of white matter degradation in each disease. Moreover, the white matter degradation seems to be more prominent in FTD than in Alzheimers disease. Taken together, the results suggest that white matter degradation measured with DTI may improve the diagnostic differentiation between FTD and Alzheimers disease.",0.42537892,0.42739943,0.4257985,0.4744564,0.40545884,0.39020237,0.39034775,0.37107652,0.46450597,0.3908297,0.41139415,0.3965035,0.40819445,0.42533958,White matter damage in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimers disease measured by diffusion MRI,1/1/2009,,Yu Zhang; Norbert Schuff; An Tao Du; Howard J.

These algorithms require large data sets to learn the separation of subjects with and without AD. Training and test data may come from heterogeneous hardware settings, which can potentially affect the performance of disease classification.A total of 518 MRI sessions from 226 healthy controls and 191 individuals with probable AD from the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to investigate whether grouping data by acquisition hardware (i.e. vendor, field strength, coil system) is beneficial for the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, compared to the case where data from different hardware is mixed. We compared the change of the SVM decision value resulting from (a) changes in hardware against the effect of disease and (b) changes resulting simply from rescanning the same subject on the same machine.Maximum accuracy of 87% was obtained with a training set of all 417 subjects. Classifiers trained with 95 subjects in each diagnostic group and acquired with heterogeneous scanner settings had an empirical detection accuracy of 84.2 ± 2.4% when tested on an independent set of the same size. These results mirror the accuracy reported in recent studies. Encouragingly, classifiers trained on images acquired with homogenous and heterogeneous hardware settings had equivalent cross-validation performances. Two scans of the same subject acquired on the same machine had very similar decision values and were generally classified into the same group. Higher variation was introduced when two acquisitions of the same subject were performed on two scanners with different field strengths. The variation was unbiased and similar for both diagnostic groups.The findings of the study encourage the pooling of data from different sites to increase the number of training samples and thereby improving performance of disease classifiers. Although small, a change in hardware could lead to a change of the decision value and thus diagnostic grouping. The findings of this study provide estimators for diagnostic accuracy of an automated disease diagnosis method involving scans acquired with different sets of hardware. Furthermore, we show that the level of confidence in the performance estimation significantly depends on the size of the training sample, and hence should be taken into account in a clinical setting. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0.51445204,0.5972719,0.59540576,0.6252951,0.58271116,0.5337063,0.5554331,0.5317997,0.56769466,0.54838914,0.5802723,0.55471087,0.5513814,0.6162773,Effects of hardware heterogeneity on the performance of SVM Alzheimer's disease classifier,10/1/2011,,Ahmed Abdulkadir; Bénédicte Mortamet; Prashanthi Vemuri; Clifford R.

Here, we examined whether this functional organization is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Task-free fMRI data from 21 AD subjects and 18 age-matched controls were obtained. Wavelet analysis was applied to the fMRI data to compute frequency-dependent correlation matrices. Correlation matrices were thresholded to create 90-node undirected-graphs of functional brain networks. Small-world metrics (characteristic path length and clustering coefficient) were computed using graph analytical methods. In the low frequency interval 0.01 to 0.05 Hz, functional brain networks in controls showed small-world organization of brain activity, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. In contrast, functional brain networks in AD showed loss of small-world properties, characterized by a significantly lower clustering coefficient (p<0.01), indicative of disrupted local connectivity. Clustering coefficients for the left and right hippocampus were significantly lower (p<0.01) in the AD group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient distinguished AD participants from the controls with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 78%. Our study provides new evidence that there is disrupted organization of functional brain networks in AD. Small-world metrics can characterize the functional organization of the brain in AD, and our findings further suggest that these network measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish AD from healthy aging. © 2008 Supekar et al.",0.4275463,0.4210294,0.41649985,0.4215459,0.42393073,0.37521383,0.39884582,0.38214356,0.4592447,0.39023888,0.4256378,0.3989753,0.4188172,0.44140622,Network analysis of intrinsic functional brain connectivity in Alzheimer's disease,1/1/2008,,Kaustubh Supekar; Vinod Menon; Daniel Rubin; Mark Musen; Michael D.

In this paper, we explore the application of different machine learning techniques to the classification of fMRI data for this purpose. The functional images were first preprocessed using the statistical parametric mapping toolbox to output individual maps of statistically activated voxels. A fast filter was applied afterwards to select voxels commonly activated across demented and nondemented groups. Four feature ranking selection techniques were embedded into a wrapper scheme using an inner-outer loop for the selection of relevant voxels. The wrapper approach was guided by the performance of six pattern recognition models, three of which were ensemble classifiers based on stochastic searches. Final classification performance was assessed from the nested internal and external cross-validation loops taking several voxel sets ordered by importance. Numerical performance was evaluated using statistical tests, and the best combination of voxel selection and classification reached a 97.14% average accuracy.

The aim of this study was to determine which method of data processing provides highest diagnostic power and to define metrics to further optimize the diagnostic value. fMRI was acquired in 21 healthy subjects, 17 subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and data evaluated both with volumes of interest (VOI)-based signal time course evaluations and independent component analyses (ICA). The first approach determines the amount of DMN region interconnectivity (as expressed with correlation coefficients); the second method determines the magnitude of DMN coactivation. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping was available in 41 of the subjects examined. Diagnostic power (expressed as accuracy) of data of a single DMN region in independent component analyses was 64%, that of a single correlation of time courses between 2 DMN regions was 71%, respectively. With multivariate analyses combining both methods of analysis and data from various regions, accuracy could be increased to 97% (sensitivity 100%, specificity 95%). In nondemented subjects, no significant differences in activity within DMN could be detected comparing ApoE ε4 allele carriers and ApoE ε4 allele noncarriers. However, there were some indications that fMRI might yield useful information given a larger sample. Time course correlation analyses seem to outperform independent component analyses in the identification of patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, multivariate analyses combining both methods of analysis by considering the activity of various parts of the DMN as well as the interconnectivity between these regions are required to achieve optimal and clinically acceptable diagnostic power. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0.49868214,0.52994347,0.53081506,0.5857471,0.46309042,0.45050442,0.4620764,0.45659178,0.5041344,0.49213424,0.51232654,0.4953936,0.52022856,0.5503377,Diagnostic power of default mode network resting state fMRI in the detection of Alzheimer's disease,3/1/2012,,Walter Koch; Stephan Teipel; Sophia Mueller; Jens Benninghoff; Maxmilian Wagner; Arun L.W.

However, biomarker discovery through data fusion is challenging since it requires extracting interpretable and reproducible patterns from data sets, consisting of shared/unshared patterns and of different orders. For example, multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals from multiple subjects can be represented as a third-order tensor with modes: Subject, time, and channel, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data may be in the form of subject by voxel matrices. Traditional data fusion methods rearrange higher-order tensors, such as EEG, as matrices to use matrix factorization-based approaches. In contrast, fusion methods based on coupled matrix and tensor factorizations (CMTF) exploit the potential multi-way structure of higher-order tensors. The CMTF approach has been shown to capture underlying patterns more accurately without imposing strong constraints on the latent neural patterns, i.e., biomarkers. In this paper, EEG, fMRI, and structural MRI (sMRI) data collected during an auditory oddball task (AOD) from a group of subjects consisting of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, are arranged as matrices and higher-order tensors coupled along the subject mode, and jointly analyzed using structure-revealing CMTF methods [also known as advanced CMTF (ACMTF)] focusing on unique identification of underlying patterns in the presence of shared/unshared patterns. We demonstrate that joint analysis of the EEG tensor and fMRI matrix using ACMTF reveals significant and biologically meaningful components in terms of differentiating between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls while also providing spatial patterns with high resolution and improving the clustering performance compared to the analysis of only the EEG tensor. We also show that these patterns are reproducible, and study reproducibility for different model parameters. In comparison to the joint independent component analysis (jICA) data fusion approach, ACMTF provides easier interpretation of EEG data by revealing a single summary map of the topography for each component. Furthermore, fusion of sMRI data with EEG and fMRI through an ACMTF model provides structural patterns; however, we also show that when fusing data sets from multiple modalities, hence of very different nature, preprocessing plays a crucial role.",0.4351717,0.53629524,0.5478511,0.5973577,0.4119057,0.40736014,0.3976145,0.3881407,0.4353052,0.4426797,0.45605135,0.45445397,0.44949794,0.45348373,Unraveling diagnostic biomarkers of schizophrenia through structure-revealing fusion of multi-modal neuroimaging data,1/1/2019,,Evrim Acar; Carla Schenker; Yuri Levin-Schwartz; Vince D.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to transform the original features from different modalities to a common space, where the transformed features become comparable and easy to find their relation, by canonical correlation analysis. We then perform the sparse multi-task learning for discriminative feature selection by using the canonical features as regressors and penalizing a loss function with a canonical regularizer.

However, there are at least four common issues associated with the existing fusion methods. First, many existing fusion methods simply concatenate features from each modality without considering the correlations among different modalities. Second, most existing methods often make prediction based on a single classifier, which might not be able to address the heterogeneity of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Third, many existing methods often employ feature selection (or reduction) and classifier training in two independent steps, without considering the fact that the two pipelined steps are highly related to each other. Forth, there are missing neuroimaging data for some of the participants (e.g., missing PET data), due to the participants’ “no-show” or dropout. In this paper, to address the above issues, we propose an early AD diagnosis framework via novel multi-modality latent space inducing ensemble SVM classifier. Specifically, we first project the neuroimaging data from different modalities into a latent space, and then map the learned latent representations into the label space to learn multiple diversified classifiers. Finally, we obtain the more reliable classification results by using an ensemble strategy. More importantly, we present a Complete Multi-modality Latent Space (CMLS) learning model for complete multi-modality data and also an Incomplete Multi-modality Latent Space (IMLS) learning model for incomplete multi-modality data. Extensive experiments using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset have demonstrated that our proposed models outperform other state-of-the-art methods.",0.5254886,0.67168206,0.6745295,0.6778503,0.5481422,0.51569045,0.4903706,0.49339962,0.53875256,0.57715195,0.5419033,0.5369658,0.54456526,0.5964399,Multi-modal latent space inducing ensemble SVM classifier for early dementia diagnosis with neuroimaging data,2/1/2020,,Tao Zhou; Kim Han Thung; Mingxia Liu; Feng Shi; Changqing Zhang; Dinggang Shen,Medical Image Analysis,60,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077503344&origin=inward,,,,,2020,"@article{,

However, PET data is not always available for several reasons, such as high cost, radiation hazard, and other limitations. This paper proposes a 3D end-to-end synthesis network called Bidirectional Mapping Generative Adversarial Networks (BMGAN). Image contexts and latent vectors are effectively used for brain MR-to-PET synthesis. Specifically, a bidirectional mapping mechanism is designed to embed the semantic information of PET images into the high-dimensional latent space. Moreover, the 3D Dense-UNet generator architecture and the hybrid loss functions are further constructed to improve the visual quality of cross-modality synthetic images.

We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters.

This is because in many cases testing all possibly useful alternatives quickly becomes prohibitively expensive. In this paper we propose a novel technique, called active testing, that intelligently selects the most useful cross-validation tests. It proceeds in a tournament-style fashion, in each round selecting and testing the algorithm that is most likely to outperform the best algorithm of the previous round on the new dataset. This 'most promising' competitor is chosen based on a history of prior duels between both algorithms on similar datasets. Each new cross-validation test will contribute information to a better estimate of dataset similarity, and thus better predict which algorithms are most promising on the new dataset. We have evaluated this approach using a set of 292 algorithm-parameter combinations on 76 UCI datasets for classification. The results show that active testing will quickly yield an algorithm whose performance is very close to the optimum, after relatively few tests. It also provides a better solution than previously proposed methods. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0.24914914,0.32112157,0.32316568,0.26795495,0.3105291,0.25657043,0.32054764,0.30888402,0.3177309,0.30562964,0.3558711,0.3029937,0.30644563,0.3449045,Selecting classification algorithms with active testing,8/17/2012,,Rui Leite; Pavel Brazdil; Joaquin Vanschoren,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),69,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84864928603&origin=inward,,,,117-131,2012,"@article{,

As one of the latest methodologies in machine learning, the deep belief network (DBN) is applied, for the first time, to quantitative analysis of GICS images with hope to segment the test and control lines with a high accuracy.

2066,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00238,3.92E-05,5,12,"Graphical, voxel, and region-based analysis has become a popular approach to studying neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its prodromal stage [mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]. These methods have been used previously for classification or discrimination of AD in subjects in a prodromal stage called stable MCI (MCIs), which does not convert to AD but remains stable over a period of time, and converting MCI (MCIc), which converts to AD, but the results reported across similar studies are often inconsistent. Furthermore, the classification accuracy for MCIs vs. MCIc is limited. In this study, we propose combining different neuroimaging modalities (sMRI, FDG-PET, AV45-PET, DTI, and rs-fMRI) with the apolipoprotein-E genotype to form a multimodal system for the discrimination of AD, and to increase the classification accuracy. Initially, we used two well-known analyses to extract features from each neuroimage for the discrimination of AD: whole-brain parcelation analysis (or region-based analysis), and voxel-wise analysis (or voxel-based morphometry). We also investigated graphical analysis (nodal and group) for all six binary classification groups (AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs). Data for a total of 129 subjects (33 AD, 30 MCIs, 31 MCIc, and 35 HCs) for each imaging modality were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage. These data also include two APOE genotype data points for the subjects. Moreover, we used the 2-mm AICHA atlas with the NiftyReg registration toolbox to extract 384 brain regions from each PET (FDG and AV45) and sMRI image. For the rs-fMRI images, we used the DPARSF toolbox in MATLAB for the automatic extraction of data and the results for REHO, ALFF, and fALFF. We also used the pyClusterROI script for the automatic parcelation of each rs-fMRI image into 200 brain regions. For the DTI images, we used the FSL (Version 6.0) toolbox for the extraction of fractional anisotropy (FA) images to calculate a tract-based spatial statistic. Moreover, we used the PANDA toolbox to obtain 50 white-matter-region-parcellated FA images on the basis of the 2-mm JHU-ICBM-labeled template atlas. To integrate the different modalities and different complementary information into one form, and to optimize the classifier, we used the multiple kernel learning (MKL) framework. The obtained results indicated that our multimodal approach yields a significant improvement in accuracy over any single modality alone. The areas under the curve obtained by the proposed method were 97.78, 96.94, 95.56, 96.25, 96.67, and 96.59% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs binary classification, respectively. Our proposed multimodal method improved the classification result for MCIs vs. MCIc groups compared with the unimodal classification results. Our study found that the (left/right) precentral region was present in all six binary classification groups (this region can be considered the most significant region). Furthermore, using nodal network topology, we found that FDG, AV45-PET, and rs-fMRI were the most important neuroimages, and showed many affected regions relative to other modalities. We also compared our results with recently published results.",0.531101,0.59502244,0.63342756,0.6656138,0.5244894,0.46712562,0.50773245,0.49856883,0.5626892,0.5655724,0.5461426,0.5290384,0.5388916,0.6006969,"Classification and Graphical Analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease and Its Prodromal Stage Using Multimodal Features From Structural, Diffusion, and Functional Neuroimaging Data and the APOE Genotype",7/30/2020,,Yubraj Gupta; Ji In Kim; Byeong Chae Kim; Goo Rak Kwon,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089422627&origin=inward,,,,,2020,"@article{,

Cortical thickness of AD patients (n=14) was measured using MRI cortical surface-based analysis and compared with healthy subjects (n=20). Data was analyzed using an automated algorithm for tissue segmentation and classification. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied over the volumetric measurements of subcortical and cortical structures to separate AD patients from controls. The group analysis showed cortical thickness reduction in the superior temporal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, and enthorhinal cortex in both hemispheres. We also found cortical thinning in the isthmus of cingulate gyrus and middle temporal gyrus at the right hemisphere, as well as a reduction of the cortical mantle in areas previously shown to be associated with AD. We also confirmed that automatic classification algorithms (SVM) could be helpful to distinguish AD patients from healthy controls. Moreover, the same areas implicated in the pathogenesis of AD were the main parameters driving the classification algorithm.

However, the possibility of overfitting should be considered, as this model is fitted with sample data. Therefore, we created and evaluated an [18F]Florbetaben amyloid brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan classification model with a Dong-A University Hospital (DAUH) dataset based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), and performed external validation with the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Spatial normalization, count normalization, and skull stripping preprocessing were performed on the DAUH and external datasets. However, smoothing was only performed on the external dataset. Three types of models were used, depending on their structure: Inception3D, ResNet3D, and VGG3D. After training with 80% of the DAUH dataset, an appropriate model was selected, and the rest of the DAUH dataset was used for model evaluation.

The proposed classification system involves five systematic levels. First, voxel-based morphometry technique is used to compare the global and local differences of gray matter in patients with AD versus healthy controls (HCs). The significant local differences in gray matter volume are then selected as volumes of interests (VOIs). Second, the voxel clusters are employed as VOIs, where each voxel is considered to be a feature. Third, all the features are ranked using t-test scores. In this regard, the Fisher Criterion between the AD and HC groups is calculated for a changing number of ranked features, where the vector size maximizing the Fisher Criterion is selected as the optimal number of top discriminative features. Fourth, the classification is performed using support vector machine. Finally, data fusion methods among atrophy clusters are used to improve the classification performance.

One major issue of automatic classification is the feature-selection method from high-dimensional data. In this paper, a novel approach for statistical feature reduction and selection in high-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data based on the probability distribution function (PDF) is introduced. To develop an automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technique, this research explores the statistical patterns extracted from structural MRI (sMRI) data on four systematic levels. First, global and local differences of gray matter in patients with AD compared to healthy controls (HCs) using the voxel-based morphometric (VBM) technique with 3-Tesla 3D T1-weighted MRI are investigated. Second, feature extraction based on the voxel clusters detected by VBM on sMRI and voxel values as volume of interest (VOI) is used. Third, a novel statistical feature-selection process is employed, utilizing the PDF of the VOI to represent statistical patterns of the respective high-dimensional sMRI sample. Finally, the proposed feature-selection method for early detection of AD with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers compared to other standard feature selection methods, such as partial least squares (PLS) techniques, is assessed. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated using 130 AD and 130 HC MRI data from the ADNI dataset with 10-fold cross validation. The results show that the PDF-based feature selection approach is a reliable technique that is highly competitive with respect to the state-of-the-art techniques in classifying AD from high-dimensional sMRI samples.",0.5054282,0.5294196,0.5352454,0.52297765,0.5129814,0.46068949,0.49196517,0.48967597,0.5253697,0.521373,0.53066474,0.522941,0.4886961,0.5893798,Probability distribution function-based classification of structural MRI for the detection of Alzheimer's disease,9/1/2015,,I.

MCI participants that converted to AD (average follow-up 15 months) displayed significantly lower volumes in a number of grey matter (GM) regions, as well as in the white matter (WM). They also displayed more pronounced periventricular small-vessel pathology, as well as an increased rate of increase of such pathology. Individual person analysis was performed using a pattern classifier previously constructed from AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) individuals to yield an abnormality score that is positive for AD-like brains and negative otherwise. The abnormality scores measured from MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) followed a bimodal distribution, reflecting the heterogeneity of this group, whereas they were positive in almost all MCI converters (MCI-C), indicating extensive patterns of AD-like brain atrophy in almost all MCI-C. Both MCI subgroups had similar MMSE scores at baseline. A more specialized classifier constructed to differentiate converters from non-converters based on their baseline scans provided good classification accuracy reaching 81.5%, evaluated via cross-validation. These pattern classification schemes, which distill spatial patterns of atrophy to a single abnormality score, offer promise as biomarkers of AD and as predictors of subsequent clinical progression, on an individual patient basis. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, the regions adjacent to hippocampus may be relevant to AD, and the visual features of the hippocampal region are important for disease diagnosis. In this paper, we have proposed a new hippocampus analysis method to combine the global and local features of hippocampus by three-dimensional densely connected convolutional networks and shape analysis for AD diagnosis.

First, features were extracted from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and useful features were selected using a feature selection method. Second, multiple modalities of MCI subjects, including MRI, positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and gene data, were individually graded using the ELM method. Finally, these grading scores calculated from different modalities were fed into a classifier to discriminate subjects with progressive MCI from those with stable MCI. The proposed approach has been validated on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, and an accuracy of 84.7% was achieved for an AD prediction within 3 years. Experiments on predicting AD conversion from MCI within different periods showed similar results with the 3-year prediction.

An accurate prediction of conversion from MCI to AD can aid clinicians to initiate treatments at early stage and monitor their effectiveness. However, existing prediction systems based on the original biosignatures are not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose to fit the prediction models using pairwise biosignature interactions, thus capturing higher-order relationship among biosignatures. Specifically, we employ hierarchical constraints and sparsity regularization to prune the high-dimensional input features. Based on the significant biosignatures and underlying interactions identified, we build classifiers to predict the conversion probability based on the selected features. We further analyze the underlying interaction effects of different biosignatures based on the so-called stable expectation scores. We have used 293 MCI subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database that have MRI measurements at the baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method achieves better classification performance than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we discover several significant interactions predictive of MCI-to-AD conversion.

What individuals themselves tell their general practitioners (GPs) is clearly important because these subjective complaints may be a clue that something is wrong. More specifically, subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) may be the first sign of AD in individuals whose cognitive performance on standard neuropsychological tasks is normal for their age. The challenge for researchers in this field is twofold: (a) determining when SCC do or do not predict current cognitive functioning and future dementia; and (b) estimating how relevant they are for patients and their proxies. The current article addresses these issues, while guidelines are also provided in an attempt to help clinicians interpret and make treatment decisions about their patients' SCC.

The key to the success of different medical image analysis algorithms is heavily dependent on how we represent the input data, namely features used to characterize the input image. In the literature, feature engineering remains as an active research topic, and many novel hand-crafted features are designed such as Haar wavelet, histogram of oriented gradient, and local binary patterns. However, such features are not designed with the guidance of the underlying dataset at hand. To this end, we argue that the most effective features should be designed in a learning based manner, namely representation learning, which can be adapted to different patient datasets at hand. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to achieve this goal. Specifically, a stacked independent subspace analysis (ISA) network is adopted to learn the most effective features in a hierarchical and unsupervised manner. The learnt features are adapted to the dataset at hand and encode high level semantic anatomical information. The proposed method is evaluated on the application of automatic prostate MR segmentation.

Automated image-based classification of individual patients could provide valuable diagnostic support for clinicians, when considered alongside cognitive assessment scores. We investigate the value of combining cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-region FDG-PET information for classification, using clinical and imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Whole-brain segmentations into 83 anatomically defined regions were automatically generated for baseline and 12-month FDG-PET images. Regional signal intensities were extracted at each timepoint, as well as changes in signal intensity over the follow-up period. Features were provided to a support vector machine classifier. By combining 12-month signal intensities and changes over 12. months, we achieve significantly increased classification performance compared with using any of the three feature sets independently. Based on this combined feature set, we report classification accuracies of 88% between patients with Alzheimer's disease and elderly healthy controls, and 65% between patients with stable mild cognitive impairment and those who subsequently progressed to Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate that information extracted from serial FDG-PET through regional analysis can be used to achieve state-of-the-art classification of diagnostic groups in a realistic multi-centre setting.

More recently, a variety of imaging modalities including structural and functional MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) studies of cerebral metabolism with fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and amyloid tracers such as Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) have shown characteristic changes in the brains of patients with AD, and in prodromal and even presymptomatic states that can help rule-in the AD pathophysiological process. No one imaging modality can serve all purposes as each have unique strengths and weaknesses. These modalities and their particular utilities are discussed in this article. The challenge for the future will be to combine imaging biomarkers to most efficiently facilitate diagnosis, disease staging, and, most importantly, development of effective disease-modifying therapies. © 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.",0.43532026,0.45949525,0.45093873,0.57679856,0.43228728,0.44338566,0.36961368,0.36052942,0.43434787,0.44205365,0.42001712,0.4594096,0.4142982,0.44944993,Brain imaging in Alzheimer disease,1/1/2012,,Keith A.

PET using 18F-labelled beta-amyloid PET tracers has shown promise for the early diagnosis of AD. However, most studies included only small numbers of participants and no consensus has been reached as to which radiotracer has the highest diagnostic accuracy. First, we performed a systematic review of the literature published between 1990 and 2014 for studies exploring the diagnostic accuracy of florbetaben, florbetapir and flutemetamol in AD. The included studies were analysed using the QUADAS assessment of methodological quality. A meta-analysis of the sensitivity and specificity reported within each study was performed. Pooled values were calculated for each radiotracer and for visual or quantitative analysis by population included. The systematic review identified nine studies eligible for inclusion. There were limited variations in the methods between studies reporting the same radiotracer. The meta-analysis results showed that pooled sensitivity and specificity values were in general high for all tracers. This was confirmed by calculating likelihood ratios. A patient with a positive ratio is much more likely to have AD than a patient with a negative ratio, and vice versa. However, specificity was higher when only patients with AD were compared with healthy controls. This systematic review and meta-analysis found no marked differences in the diagnostic accuracy of the three beta-amyloid radiotracers. All tracers perform better when used to discriminate between patients with AD and healthy controls. The sensitivity and specificity for quantitative and visual analysis are comparable to those of other imaging or biomarker techniques used to diagnose AD. Further research is required to identify the combination of tests that provides the highest sensitivity and specificity, and to identify the most suitable position for the tracer in the clinical pathway.",0.4036996,0.47764456,0.46165812,0.5737428,0.4265635,0.42715064,0.41484508,0.39662594,0.4504601,0.42270863,0.42687905,0.40787956,0.43832853,0.4466142,Diagnostic accuracy of 18F amyloid PET tracers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2/1/2016,,Elizabeth Morris; Anastasia Chalkidou; Alexander Hammers; Janet Peacock; Jennifer Summers; Stephen Keevil,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,173,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84952987419&origin=inward,,,,374-385,2016,"@article{,

Several methods have been used for the predictions of structured neuroimaging data, yet nobody compared them in this context. Objective: Multi-class prediction is key for building computational aid systems for differential diagnosis. We compared support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep feed-forward neural networks for the classification of different neurodegenerative syndromes based on structural magnetic resonance imaging. Design, setting, and participants: Atlas-based volumetry was performed on multi-centric T1-weighted MRI data from 940 subjects, i.e., 124 healthy controls and 816 patients with ten different neurodegenerative diseases, leading to a multi-diagnostic multi-class classification task with eleven different classes. Interventions: N.A. Main outcomes and measures: Cohen’s kappa, accuracy, and F1-score to assess model performance. Results: Overall, the neural network produced both the best performance measures and the most robust results. The smaller classes however were better classified by either the ensemble learning methods or the support vector machine, while performance measures for small classes were comparatively low, as expected. Diseases with regionally specific and pronounced atrophy patterns were generally better classified than diseases with widespread and rather weak atrophy.

The NIA-AA initiative also built upon research criteria for AD proposed by the International Working Group (IWG) in 2007 and updated in 2010. These efforts to revise the criteria reflect the need to improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate clinical trials, and establish a common set of criteria that are universally accepted across domains of clinical practice, research, and drug development. To ensure that the proposed NIA-AA criteria remain as current as possible, the Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable convened a meeting in Washington, DC, on October 1 and 2, 2012, bringing together international stakeholders from industry, academia, and regulatory agencies to identify areas of agreement and research gaps respective of NIA-AA criteria and IWG recommendations. © 2013 The Alzheimer¢s Association.

In this work, a complete computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for an automatic evaluation of the neuroimages is presented.

Almost all modalities have transitioned to direct digital capture devices, which have emerged as a major future healthcare option. Three diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD), Haemorrhage (HD), and COVID-19 have been used in this manuscript for binary classification purposes. Three datasets (AD, HD, and COVID-19) were used in this research out of which the first two, that is, AD and HD belong to brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the last one, that is, COVID-19 belongs to Chest X-Ray (CXR) All of the diseases listed above cannot be eliminated, but they can be slowed down with early detection and effective medical treatment. This paper proposes an intelligent method for classifying brain (MRI) and CXR images into normal and abnormal classes for the early detection of AD, HD, and COVID-19 based on an ensemble deep neural network (DNN). In the proposed method, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for automatic feature extraction from images and long-short term memory (LSTM) is used for final classification. Moreover, the Hill-Climbing Algorithm (HCA) is implemented for finding the best possible value for hyper parameters of CNN and LSTM, such as the filter size of CNN and the number of units of LSTM while fixing the other parameters. The data-set is pre-processed (resized, cropped, and noise removed) before feeding the train images to the proposed models for accurate and fast learning. Forty-five MR images of AD, Sixty MR images of HD, and 600 CXR images of COVID-19 were used for testing the proposed model ‘CNN-LSTM-HCA’. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using six types of statistical assessment metrics such as; Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F-measure, ROC, and AUC. The proposed model compared with the other three types of hybrid models such as CNN-LSTM-PSO, CNN-LSTM-Jaya, and CNN-LSTM-GWO and also with state-of-art techniques.

Here we compare baseline CMRgl measurements from 74 pAD patients and 142 aMCI patients to those from 82 NC, we correlate CMRgl with categorical and continuous measures of clinical disease severity, and we compare apolipoprotein E (APOE) e{open}4 carriers to non-carriers in each of these subject groups.

However, when analyses were restricted to the pAD patients, lower MMSE scores were significantly correlated with lower left frontal and temporal CMRgl.

The results showed that in terms of the MCI transformation prediction, the sensitivity and specificity of conv3 classification were respectively 91.02% and 77.63%; in terms of the Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI) and Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) classification, the accuracy of conv5 classification was 72.19%, and the sensitivity and specificity of conv5 were all 73% approximately. Thus, it was seen that the model constructed in the research could be used to solve the problems of MCI transformation prediction, which also had certain effects on the classifications of EMCI and LMCI. The risk prediction of AD based on the deep learning model of brain 18F-FDG PET discussed in the research matched the expected results. It provided a relatively accurate reference model for the prediction of AD.

This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 4 × 107 individual classifications made by ∼10 5 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provide a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structural parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour-magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology. © 2008 RAS.",0.2354317,0.22613344,0.27307406,0.2220534,0.261251,0.16648114,0.21294199,0.18953815,0.27634984,0.25337136,0.24827497,0.23287548,0.23686552,0.28889063,Galaxy Zoo: Morphologies derived from visual inspection of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,1/1/2008,,Chris J.

Despite the high performances reported in numerous studies, developing CNN models with good generalization abilities is still a challenging task due to possible data leakage introduced during cross-validation (CV). In this study, we quantitatively assessed the effect of a data leakage caused by 3D MRI data splitting based on a 2D slice-level using three 2D CNN models to classify patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our experiments showed that slice-level CV erroneously boosted the average slice level accuracy on the test set by 30% on Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), 29% on Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 48% on Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and 55% on a local de-novo PD Versilia dataset. Further tests on a randomly labeled OASIS-derived dataset produced about 96% of (erroneous) accuracy (slice-level split) and 50% accuracy (subject-level split), as expected from a randomized experiment.

However, due to the scarcity of training neuroimaging data, many deep learning models have suffered from severe overfitting. In this study, we propose an ensemble learning framework that combines deep learning and machine learning. The deep learning model was based on a 3D-ResNet to exploit 3D structural features of neuroimaging data. Meanwhile, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning was applied on a voxel-wise basis to draw the most significant voxel groups out of the image. The 3D-ResNet and XGBoost predictions were combined with patient demographics and cognitive test scores (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)) to give a final diagnosis prediction. Our proposed method was trained and validated on brain MRI brain images of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. During the training phase, multiple data augmentation methods were employed to tackle overfitting. Our test set contained only baseline scans, i.e., the first visit scans since we aimed to investigate the ability of our approach in detecting AD during the first visit of AD patients. Our 5-fold cross-validation implementation achieved an average AUC of 100% during training and 96% during testing. Using the same computer, our method was much faster in scoring a prediction, approximately 10 min, than feature extraction-based machine learning methods, which often take many hours to score a prediction. To make the prediction explainable, we visualized the brain MRI image regions that primarily affected the 3D-ResNet model's prediction via heatmap.

An understanding of the pathology of aMCI may benefit the development of effective clinical treatments for dementia. In this work, we measured the cortical thickness of 109 aMCI subjects and 99 normal controls (NC) twice over two years. The longitudinal changes and the cross-sectional differences between the two types of participants were explored using the vertex thickness values. The thickness of the cortex in aMCI was found significantly reduced in both longitudinal and between-group comparisons, mainly in the temporal lobe, superolateral parietal lobe and some regions of the frontal cortices. Compared to NC, the aMCI showed a significantly high atrophy rate in the left lateral temporal lobe and left parahippocampal gyrus over two years. Additionally, a significant positive correlation between brain atrophy and the decline of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores was also found in the left superior and left middle temporal gyrus in aMCI. These findings demonstrated specific longitudinal spatial patterns of cortical atrophy in aMCI and NC. The higher atrophy rate in aMCI might be responsible for the accelerated functional decline in the aMCI progression process. © 2012 Yao et al.",0.40053284,0.37998244,0.4034713,0.40956146,0.38604715,0.37042037,0.36823136,0.35537222,0.45526937,0.39795232,0.40798652,0.3655693,0.42984125,0.42596462,A Longitudinal Study of Atrophy in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Normal Aging Revealed by Cortical Thickness,11/2/2012,,Zhijun Yao; Bin Hu; Chuanjiang Liang; Lina Zhao; Mike Jackson,PLoS ONE,53,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84868309643&origin=inward,,,,,2012,"@article{,

However, many approaches do not give an intuitive relation between the raw features and the diagnosis. Therefore, they are difficult for clinicians to interpret. Moreover, most approaches treat the features extracted from the brain (for example, voxelwise gray matter concentration maps from brain MRI) as independent variables and ignore their spatial and anatomical relations. In this paper, we present a new Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based learning method for the classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which integrates spatial-anatomical information. In this way, spatial-neighbor features in the same anatomical region are encouraged to have similar weights in the SVM model. Secondly, we introduce a group lasso penalty to induce structure sparsity, which may help clinicians to assess the key regions involved in the disease. For solving this learning problem, we use an accelerated proximal gradient descent approach. We tested our method on the subset of ADNI data selected by Cuingnet et al. (2011) for Alzheimer's disease classification, as well as on an independent larger dataset from ADNI. Good classification performance is obtained for distinguishing cognitive normals (CN) vs. AD, as well as on distinguishing between various sub-types (e.g. CN vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment). The model trained on Cuignet's dataset for AD vs. CN classification was directly used without re-training to the independent larger dataset. Good performance was achieved, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed methods. For all experiments, the classification results are comparable or better than the state-of-the-art, while the weight map more clearly indicates the key regions related to Alzheimer's disease.",0.6051716,0.60609007,0.6140221,0.5565861,0.59359634,0.50503737,0.55217916,0.544347,0.5911954,0.59699625,0.58507055,0.55529416,0.57619107,0.6377214,Integrating spatial-anatomical regularization and structure sparsity into SVM: Improving interpretation of Alzheimer's disease classification,9/1/2018,,Zhuo Sun; Yuchuan Qiao; Boudewijn P.F.

1960,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222446,3.98E-05,6,5,"In recent years, several high-dimensional, accurate, and effective classification methods have been proposed for the automatic discrimination of the subject between Alzheimer's disease (AD) or its prodromal phase {i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)} and healthy control (HC) persons based on T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). These methods emphasis only on using the individual feature from sMRI images for the classification of AD, MCI, and HC subjects and their achieved classification accuracy is low. However, latest multimodal studies have shown that combining multiple features from different sMRI analysis techniques can improve the classification accuracy for these types of subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel classification technique that precisely distinguishes individuals with AD, aAD (stable MCI, who had not converted to AD within a 36-month time period), and mAD (MCI caused by AD, who had converted to AD within a 36-month time period) from HC individuals. The proposed method combines three different features extracted from structural MR (sMR) images using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), hippocampal volume (HV), and cortical and subcortical segmented region techniques. Three classification experiments were performed (AD vs. HC, aAD vs. mAD, and HC vs. mAD) with 326 subjects (171 elderly controls and 81 AD, 35 aAD, and 39 mAD patients). For the development and validation of the proposed classification method, we acquired the sMR images from the dataset of the National Research Center for Dementia (NRCD). A five-fold crossvalidation technique was applied to find the optimal hyperparameters for the classifier, and the classification performance was compared by using three well-known classifiers: K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and random forest. Overall, the proposed model with the SVM classifier achieved the best performance on the NRCD dataset. For the individual feature, the VBM technique provided the best results followed by the HV technique. However, the use of combined features improved the classification accuracy and predictive power for the early classification of AD compared to the use of individual features. The most stable and reliable classification results were achieved when combining all extracted features. Additionally, to analyze the efficiency of the proposed model, we used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to compare the classification performance of the proposed model with those of several state-of-the-art methods.",0.561961,0.60476655,0.65097463,0.6253352,0.5625707,0.47934252,0.53189594,0.53303385,0.5937439,0.60480934,0.5807595,0.5524267,0.58780193,0.64949954,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using combined features from voxel-based morphometry and cortical, subcortical, and hippocampus regions of MRI T1 brain images",10/1/2019,,Yubraj Gupta; Kun Ho Lee; Kyu Yeong Choi; Jang Jae Lee; Byeong Chae Kim; Goo Rak Kwon,PLoS ONE,55,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072941051&origin=inward,,,,,2019,"@article{,

We believe that there exist latent complicated patterns, e.g., non-linear relations, inherent in the low-level features. Combining latent information with the original low-level features helps build a robust model for AD/MCI classification with high diagnostic accuracy.

Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have focused on the slowing of oscillatory brain rhythms, coupled with complexity reduction of the corresponding time-series and their enhanced compressibility. These analyses have been typically carried out on single channels. However, limited investigations have focused on the possibility yielded by computational intelligence methodologies and novel machine learning approaches applied to multichannel schemes. The study at screening level on EEG recordings of subjects at risk could be useful to highlight the emergence of underlying AD progression (or at least support any further clinical investigation). In this work, the representational power of Deep Learning on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is exploited to generate suitable sets of features that are then able to classify EEG patterns of AD from a prodromal version of dementia (Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) and from age-matched Healthy Controls (HC). The processing system here used enforces a series of convolutional-subsampling layers in order to derive a multivariate assembly of latent, novel patterns, finally used to categorize sets of EEG from different classes of subjects.

Deep learning allows researchers to find multi-modal biomarkers to develop more effective and personalized treatments, early diagnosis tools, as well as useful information for drug discovering and repurposing in neurodegenerative pathologies.

The advanced deep learning method, a novel brain imaging technique, was applied in this study to evaluate its contribution to improving the diagnostic accuracy of AD. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) were applied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to execute binary and ternary disease classification models. The dataset from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) was used to compare the deep learning performances across 3D-CNN, 3D-CNN-support vector machine (SVM) and two-dimensional (2D)-CNN models. The outcomes of accuracy with ternary classification for 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN and 3D-CNN-SVM were 82.57 ± 7.35%, 89.76 ± 8.67% and 95.74 ± 2.31% respectively. The 3D-CNN-SVM yielded a ternary classification accuracy of 93.71%, 96.82% and 96.73% for NC, MCI and AD diagnoses, respectively. Furthermore, 3D-CNN-SVM showed the best performance for binary classification. Our study indicated that 'NC versus MCI' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.90%, 98.90% and 98.80%; 'NC versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.10%, 99.80% and 98.40%; and 'MCI versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 89.40%, 86.70% and 84.00%, respectively. This study clearly demonstrates that 3D-CNN-SVM yields better performance with MRI compared to currently utilized deep learning methods. In addition, 3D-CNN-SVM proved to be efficient without having to manually perform any prior feature extraction and is totally independent of the variability of imaging protocols and scanners. This suggests that it can potentially be exploited by untrained operators and extended to virtual patient imaging data. Furthermore, owing to the safety, noninvasiveness and nonirradiative properties of the MRI modality, 3D-CNN-SMV may serve as an effective screening option for AD in the general population.

In Europe the average delay is 20 months. Nevertheless, patient data preceding clinical AD diagnoses often contains early signs of the disease. Several studies have analyzed data of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, showing that conversion from MCI to AD can be predicted with a classification accuracy of 60-80%. This accuracy may not be high enough for influencing diagnostic decisions. In this work, the prediction problem is approached differently; a target prediction accuracy is defined first and is then used for identifying MCI patients for whom the required accuracy can be reached. The process uses a novel disease state index method in which patient data are statistically compared to a high number of previously diagnosed cases. It is shown that the disease index values derived from heterogeneous patient data can be used for identifying groups of patients for whom the prediction accuracy reaches the previously set target level. The results also show that 12 months before receiving clinical AD diagnoses, approximately half (51.5%, 95% confidence interval: 48.6-54.2%) of MCI subjects who progressed to AD can be classified with a high accuracy of 87.7%, possibly enough to support earlier diagnostic decisions. © 2012-IOS Press and the authors.

Most of existing joint learning approaches require hand-crafted feature representations for MR images. Since hand-crafted features of MRI and classification/regression models may not coordinate well with each other, conventional methods may lead to sub-optimal learning performance. Also, demographic information (e.g., age, gender, and education) of subjects may also be related to brain status, and thus can help improve the diagnostic performance. However, conventional joint learning methods seldom incorporate such demographic information into the learning models. To this end, we propose a deep multi-task multi-channel learning (DM2L) framework for simultaneous brain disease classification and clinical score regression, using MRI data and demographic information of subjects. Specifically, we first identify the discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then extract multiple image patches around these detected landmarks. We then propose a deep multi-task multi-channel convolutional neural network for joint classification and regression. Our DM2L framework can not only automatically learn discriminative features for MR images, but also explicitly incorporate the demographic information of subjects into the learning process. We evaluate the proposed method on four large multi-center cohorts with 1984 subjects, and the experimental results demonstrate that DM2L is superior to several state-of-the-art joint learning methods in both the tasks of disease classification and clinical score regression.",0.5430116,0.59467024,0.6061663,0.61868304,0.5697766,0.53305316,0.5198189,0.5171986,0.50990057,0.57064146,0.58151764,0.5621265,0.57060474,0.58644193,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

However, identifying the distinctions between Alzheimer's brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 75) is challenging due to highly similar brain patterns and image intensities.

Multimodality neuroimaging data such as MRI and PET provide valuable insights into brain abnormalities, while genetic data such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) provide information about a patient's AD risk factors. When these data are used together, the accuracy of AD diagnosis may be improved. However, these data are heterogeneous (e.g., with different data distributions), and have different number of samples (e.g., with far less number of PET samples than the number of MRI or SNPs). Thus, learning an effective model using these data is challenging. To this end, we present a novel three-stage deep feature learning and fusion framework, where deep neural network is trained stage-wise. Each stage of the network learns feature representations for different combinations of modalities, via effective training using the maximum number of available samples. Specifically, in the first stage, we learn latent representations (i.e., high-level features) for each modality independently, so that the heterogeneity among modalities can be partially addressed, and high-level features from different modalities can be combined in the next stage. In the second stage, we learn joint latent features for each pair of modality combination by using the high-level features learned from the first stage. In the third stage, we learn the diagnostic labels by fusing the learned joint latent features from the second stage. To further increase the number of samples during training, we also use data at multiple scanning time points for each training subject in the dataset.

A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurocognitive disorder occurring in people in their early onset. This disease causes the person to suffer from memory loss, unusual behavior, and language problems. Early detection is essential for developing more advanced treatments for AD. Machine learning (ML), a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), uses various probabilistic and optimization techniques to help computers learn from huge and complicated data sets. To diagnose AD in its early stages, researchers generally use machine learning. The survey provides a broad overview of current research in this field and analyses the classification methods used by researchers working with ADNI data sets. It discusses essential research topics such as the data sets used, the evaluation measures employed, and the machine learning methods used. Our presentation suggests a model that helps better understand current work and highlights the challenges and opportunities for innovative and useful research. The study shows which machine learning method holds best for the ADNI data set. Therefore, the focus is given to two methods: the 18-layer convolutional network and the 3D convolutional network. Hence, CNNs with multi-layered fetch more accurate results as compared to 3D CNN. The work also contributes to the use of the ADNI data set, where the classification of training and testing samples is divided with such a number that brings the highest accuracy achieved with 18-layer CNN.

The proposed denoising scheme operates in two steps. Firstly, the pixels are segregated as 'noisy' and 'noise-free' so that the subsequent processing can be carried out only for the noisy pixels only in the next step. Secondly, the identified noisy pixels are replaced by the median value or by its neighboring pixel value. The term 'adaptive' justifies the filters' capability to increase the size of the spatial window, depending upon the decisions made based on statistical parameters (estimated within the local window). Further, the 'non-iterative' feature projects that there is no need of recursive filtering to reduce the residual noise content. The proposed denoising method is tested on images with different characteristics and is found to produce better results in terms of the qualitative and quantitative measures of the image in comparison to other filtering approaches. © 2014 IEEE.",0.16313332,0.25055832,0.21712346,0.20829082,0.2078632,0.22026607,0.19440082,0.18959366,0.25674736,0.23491204,0.2587069,0.24379404,0.20761985,0.2839748,A non-iterative adaptive median filter for image denoising,1/1/2014,,Vikrant Bhateja; Kartikeya Rastogi; Aviral Verma; Chirag Malhotra,"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks, SPIN 2014",35,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84902485735&origin=inward,,,,113-118,2014,"@article{,

Multimodality neuroimaging data such as MRI and PET provide valuable insights to abnormalities, and genetic data such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) provide information about a patient’s AD risk factors. When used in conjunction, AD diagnosis may be improved. However, these data are heterogeneous (e.g., having different data distributions), and have different number of samples (e.g., PET data is having far less number of samples than the numbers of MRI or SNPs). Thus, learning an effective model using these data is challenging. To this end, we present a novel three-stage deep feature learning and fusion framework, where the deep neural network is trained stage-wise. Each stage of the network learns feature representations for different combination of modalities, via effective training using maximum number of available samples. Specifically, in the first stage, we learn latent representations (i.e., high-level features) for each modality independently, so that the heterogeneity between modalities can be better addressed and then combined in the next stage. In the second stage, we learn the joint latent features for each pair of modality combination by using the high-level features learned from the first stage. In the third stage, we learn the diagnostic labels by fusing the learned joint latent features from the second stage.

Specifically, we first use sparse linear regressions to remove unrelated features. Then, considering the heterogeneity of the MCI data, which can be assumed as a union of multiple subspaces, we propose to use a low rank subspace method (i.e., LRAD) to denoise the data. Finally, we employ LRMC algorithm with three data fitting terms and one inequality constraint for joint conversion and time-to-conversion predictions. Our framework aims to answer a very important but yet rarely explored question in AD study, i.e., when will the MCI convert to AD? This is different from survival analysis, which provides the probabilities of conversion at different time points that are mainly used for global analysis, while our time-to-conversion prediction is for each individual subject.

Precisely, we compare our three recent proposed feature selection methods (i.e. multiple kernel learning (MKL), high order graph matching based feature selection (HGM-FS), sparse multimodal learning (SMML)) using four widely-used modalities (i.e. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and genetic modality single-nucleotide polymor phism (SNP)). This study demonstrates the performance of each method using these modalities individually or integratively, and may be valuable to clinical tests in practice. Our experimental results suggest that for AD prediction, in general, (1) in terms of accuracy, PET is the best modality; (2) Even though the discriminant power of genetic SNP features is weak, adding this modality to other modalities does help improve the classification accuracy; (3) HGM-FS works best among the three feature selection methods; (4) Some of the selected features are shared by all the feature selection methods, which may have high correlation with the disease.

Several studies have resulted in many methods of early detection of AD, which benefit patient outcomes and new findings on the development of a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of this disease. Therefore, using the operation of electronic computers to diagnose automatically the incident of AD has served a vital role in supporting clinicians as well as easing significant elaboration on manual and subjectively AD diagnosing of clinicians for the patient’s beneficial outcomes.

The approach incorporates the recently developed Self-adaptive Resource Allocation Network (SRAN) for Alzheimer's disease classification using voxel-based morphometric features of MR images. SRAN classifier uses a sequential learning algorithm, employing self-adaptive thresholds to select the appropriate training samples and discard redundant samples to prevent over-training. These selected training samples are then used to evolve the network architecture efficiently. Since, the number of features extracted from the MR images is large, a feature selection scheme (to reduce the number of features needed) using an Integer-Coded Genetic Algorithm (ICGA) in conjunction with the SRAN classifier (referred to here as the ICGA-SRAN classifier) have been developed. In this study, different healthy/Alzheimer's disease patient's MR images from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies data set have been used for the performance evaluation of the proposed ICGA-SRAN classifier. We have also compared the results of the ICGA-SRAN classifier with the well-known Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifiers. The study results clearly show that the ICGA-SRAN classifier produces a better generalization performance with a smaller number of features, lower misclassification rate and a compact network. The ICGA-SRAN selected features clearly indicate that the variations in the gray matter volume in the parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala brain regions may be good indicators of the onset of Alzheimer's disease in normal persons. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",0.5331363,0.551165,0.5421388,0.49291614,0.5227023,0.4656964,0.49707675,0.50132656,0.5323072,0.56243783,0.53058624,0.50507784,0.5556944,0.6090904,Identification of brain regions responsible for Alzheimer's disease using a Self-adaptive Resource Allocation Network,8/1/2012,,B.

This method is affine-invariant and stable against noise and shape deformations. Shapes which have undergone mirror reflection can also be retrieved in a unified manner. In this approach, similarity matching is cast as correspondence matching of two shapes which is then solved by minimizing the matching errors between two feature vectors. Since our feature vectors simultaneously capture both local and global affine-invariant features of shapes, this formulation makes our solution to the correspondence problem very robust. To render the technique suitable for interactive image retrieval, a fast error minimization algorithm for computing correspondence matching is further proposed.

Under this framework, we learn a robust decision function (referred to as target classifier) for label prediction of instances from the target domain by leveraging a set of base classifiers which are prelearned by using labeled instances either from the source domains or from the source domains and the target domain. With the base classifiers, we propose a new domain-dependent regularizer based on smoothness assumption, which enforces that the target classifier shares similar decision values with the relevant base classifiers on the unlabeled instances from the target domain. This newly proposed regularizer can be readily incorporated into many kernel methods (e.g., support vector machines (SVM), support vector regression, and least-squares SVM (LS-SVM)). For domain adaptation, we also develop two new domain adaptation methods referred to as FastDAM and UniverDAM. In FastDAM, we introduce our proposed domain-dependent regularizer into LS-SVM as well as employ a sparsity regularizer to learn a sparse target classifier with the support vectors only from the target domain, which thus makes the label prediction on any test instance very fast. In UniverDAM, we additionally make use of the instances from the source domains as Universum to further enhance the generalization ability of the target classifier. We evaluate our two methods on the challenging TRECIVD 2005 dataset for the large-scale video concept detection task as well as on the 20 newsgroups and email spam datasets for document retrieval. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FastDAM and UniverDAM outperform the existing multiple source domain adaptation methods for the two applications. © 2012 IEEE.",0.31198576,0.30960402,0.3323343,0.24910425,0.32703462,0.24085566,0.31868652,0.32178482,0.28109396,0.26822326,0.2756806,0.28901523,0.25901458,0.30766785,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

In order to overcome problems of conventional classical machine learning methods, the AlexNet classifier, with a deep learning architecture, was employed for training and classification. A data permutation scheme including slice integration, outlier removal, and entropy-based sMRI slice selection is proposed to utilize the benefits of AlexNet. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively utilize the AlexNet with the proposed data permutation scheme by significantly improving overall classification accuracies for AD classification.

Specifically, we parcellate the brain into predefined regions based on anatomical knowledge (i.e., templates) and derive complex nonlinear relationships among voxels, whose intensities denote volumetric measurements, within each region. Unlike existing methods that use cubical or rectangular shapes, we consider the anatomical shapes of regions as atypical patches. Using complex nonlinear relationships among voxels in each region learned by deep neural networks, we extract a “regional abnormality representation.” We then make a final clinical decision by integrating the regional abnormality representations over the entire brain. It is noteworthy that the regional abnormality representations allow us to interpret and understand the symptomatic observations of a subject with AD or MCI by mapping and visualizing these observations in the brain space.

First, we extracted features (volume and shape) from MRI data by using a series of image processing steps. Subsequently, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to convert a set of features of possibly correlated variables into a smaller set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables, decreasing the dimensions of feature space. Finally, we developed a novel data mining framework in combination with support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the AD/MCI classification. In order to compare the hybrid method with traditional classifier, two kinds of classifiers, that is, SVM and a self-organizing map (SOM), were trained for patient classification. With the proposed framework, the classification accuracy is improved up to 82.35% and 77.78% in patients with AD and MCI. The result achieved up to 94.12% and 88.89% in AD and MCI by combining the volumetric features and shape features and using PCA.

Images were segmented and normalized using SPM8 and ANTS software packages.

To avoid optimistic estimates classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined based on a combination of three-way split of the data with nested 10-fold cross-validations. One of the main features of this approach is that classification is performed based on large scale regularization.

Collecting the feature values into a matrix, with each row containing a feature vector of a sample, we propose a framework to predict the corresponding associated multiple target outputs (e.g., diagnosis label and clinical scores) from this feature matrix by performing matrix shrinkage following matrix completion. Specifically, we first combine the feature and target output matrices into a large matrix and then partition this large incomplete matrix into smaller submatrices, each consisting of samples with complete feature values (corresponding to a certain combination of modalities) and target outputs. Treating each target output as the outcome of a prediction task, we apply a 2-step multi-task learning algorithm to select the most discriminative features and samples in each submatrix. Features and samples that are not selected in any of the submatrices are discarded, resulting in a shrunk version of the original large matrix. The missing feature values and unknown target outputs of the shrunk matrix is then completed simultaneously.

To utilize all available subjects to train diagnostic models, deep networks have been proposed to directly impute missing neuroimages by treating all voxels in a 3D volume equally. These methods are not diagnosis-oriented, as they ignore the disease-image specific information conveyed in multi-modal neuroimages, i.e., (1) disease may cause abnormalities only at local brain regions, and (2) different modalities may highlight different disease-associated regions. In this paper, we propose a unified disease-image specific deep learning framework for joint image synthesis and disease diagnosis using incomplete multi-modal neuroimaging data. Specifically, by using the whole-brain images as input, we design a disease-image specific neural network (DSNN) to implicitly model disease-image specificity in MRI/PET scans using the spatial cosine kernel. Moreover, we develop a feature-consistent generative adversarial network (FGAN) to synthesize missing images, encouraging DSNN feature maps of synthetic images and their respective real images to be consistent. Our DSNN and FGAN can be jointly trained, by which missing images are imputed in a task-oriented manner for brain disease diagnosis.

However, most of the existing research focuses on the use of single-modal (e.g., structural or functional MRI) or single-level (e.g., brain local or connectivity metrics) biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. In this study, we propose a methodological framework, called multi-modal imaging and multi-level characteristics with multi-classifier (M3), to discriminate patients with AD from healthy controls. This approach involved data analysis from two imaging modalities: structural MRI, which was used to measure regional gray matter volume, and resting-state functional MRI, which was used to measure three different levels of functional characteristics, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and regional functional connectivity strength (RFCS). For each metric, we computed the values of ninety regions of interest derived from a prior atlas, which were then further trained using a multi-classifier based on four maximum uncertainty linear discriminant analysis base classifiers. The performance of this method was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Applying the M3 approach to the dataset containing 16 AD patients and 22 healthy controls led to a classification accuracy of 89.47% with a sensitivity of 87.50% and a specificity of 90.91%. Further analysis revealed that the most discriminative features for classification are predominantly involved in several default-mode (medial frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus), occipital (fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle occipital gyrus) and subcortical (amygdale and pallidum of lenticular nucleus) regions. Thus, the M3 method shows promising classification performance by incorporating information from different imaging modalities and different functional properties, and it has the potential to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation of AD. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0.54207,0.6025425,0.6321228,0.63424104,0.52430063,0.47453833,0.48957947,0.48690414,0.55273867,0.57631904,0.54519355,0.51646507,0.5628239,0.61512446,Discriminative analysis of early Alzheimer's disease using multi-modal imaging and multi-level characterization with multi-classifier (M3),2/1/2012,,Zhengjia Dai; Chaogan Yan; Zhiqun Wang; Jinhui Wang; Mingrui Xia; Kuncheng Li; Yong He,NeuroImage,244,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84855434935&origin=inward,,,,2187-2195,2012,"@article{,

In this study, we present a sophisticated machine learning (ML) model of great accuracy to diagnose the early stages of AD. A total of 373 MRI tests belonging to 150 subjects (age ≥ 60) were examined and analyzed in parallel with fourteen distinct features related to standard AD diagnosis. Four ML models, such as naive Bayes (NB), artificial neural networks (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support-vector machines (SVM), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve metric were used to validate the model performance. Each model evaluation was done in three independent experiments. In the first experiment, a manual feature selection was used for model training, and ANN generated the highest accuracy in terms of ROC (0.812). In the second experiment, automatic feature selection was conducted by wrapping methods, and the NB achieved the highest ROC of 0.942. The last experiment consisted of an ensemble or hybrid modeling developed to combine the four models. This approach resulted in an improved accuracy ROC of 0.991.

They have been recently investigated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis. This is a normal “knowledge diffusion” process, when methodologies developed for multimedia mining penetrate a new application area. The latter brings its own specificities requiring an adjustment of methodologies on the basis of domain knowledge. In this paper, we develop an automatic classification framework for AD recognition in structural Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). The main contribution of this work consists in considering visual features from the most involved region in AD (hippocampal area) and in using a late fusion to increase precision results. Our approach has been first evaluated on the baseline MR images of 218 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and then tested on a 3T weighted contrast MRI obtained from a subsample of a large French epidemiological study: “Bordeaux dataset”. The experimental results show that our classification of patients with AD versus NC (Normal Control) subjects achieves the accuracies of 87 % and 85 % for ADNI subset and “Bordeaux dataset” respectively. For the most challenging group of subjects with the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), we reach accuracies of 78.22 % and 72.23 % for MCI versus NC and MCI versus AD respectively on ADNI. The late fusion scheme improves classification results by 9 % in average for these three categories.

This variability likely reflects underlying genetic, environmental and neuropathological differences. Characterizing this heterogeneity is important for precision diagnostics, personalized predictions, and recruitment of relatively homogeneous sets of patients into clinical trials. In this study, we apply state-of-the-art semi-supervised machine learning methods to the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging cohort (ADNI) to elucidate the heterogeneity of neuroanatomical differences between subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 530) and Alzheimer’s disease (n = 314) and cognitively normal individuals (n = 399), thereby adding to an increasing literature aiming to establish neuroanatomical and neuropathological (e.g. amyloid and tau deposition) dimensions in Alzheimer’s disease and its prodromal stages. These dimensional approaches aim to provide surrogate measures of heterogeneous underlying pathologic processes leading to cognitive impairment. We relate these neuroimaging patterns to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, white matter hyperintensities, cognitive and clinical measures, and longitudinal trajectories. We identified four such atrophy patterns: (i) individuals with largely normal neuroanatomical profiles, who also turned out to have the least abnormal cognitive and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profiles and the slowest clinical progression during follow-up; (ii) individuals with classical Alzheimer’s disease neuroanatomical, cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and clinical profile, who presented the fastest clinical progression; (iii) individuals with a diffuse pattern of atrophy with relatively less pronounced involvement of the medial temporal lobe, abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-b1-42 values, and proportionally greater executive impairment; and (iv) individuals with notably focal involvement of the medial temporal lobe and a slow steady progression, likely representing in early Alzheimer’s disease stages. These four atrophy patterns effectively define a 4-dimensional categorization of neuroanatomical alterations in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease that can complement existing dimensional approaches for staging Alzheimer’s disease using a variety of biomarkers, which offer the potential for enabling precision diagnostics and prognostics, as well as targeted patient recruitment of relatively homogeneous subgroups of subjects for clinical trials.",0.52714396,0.548017,0.5721654,0.55792147,0.5323553,0.501603,0.5195814,0.5016656,0.570439,0.5395506,0.5585049,0.53387046,0.5421565,0.53912115,"Heterogeneity of neuroanatomical patterns in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease: links to cognition, progression and biomarkers",3/1/2017,,Aoyan Dong; Jon B.

However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the “average” patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method—similarity network fusion—to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinson’s disease from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from the fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes.

The large number of subjects that result from pooling multi-center datasets increases sensitivity, but also introduces a between-center variance component. Taking sex differences as an example, we examined the effects of different ratios of cases to controls (males to females) between scanners in multi-scanner morphometric studies, using voxel-based morphometry and data obtained on two scanners of the exact same model. Each subject was scanned twice with both scanners. Using the image obtained on either of the two scanners for each subject, voxel-based analyses were repeated with different ratios of males to females for each scanner. As the ratio of males to females became more imbalanced between the scanners, the differences between the two scanners more strongly affected the results of analyses of sex differences. When the ratio of males to females was balanced, the inclusion of scanner as a covariate in the statistical analysis had almost no influence on the results of analyses of sex differences. When the ratio of males to females was ill-balanced, the inclusion of scanner as a covariate suppressed scanner effects on the results, but made sex differences less likely to become significant. The present results suggest that as long as the ratio of cases to controls is well-balanced across different scanners, it is not always necessary to include scanner as a covariate in the statistical analysis, and that when the ratio of cases to controls is ill-balanced across scanners, the inclusion of scanner as a covariate in the statistical analysis can suppress scanner effects, but may make differences less likely to be detected. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",0.3190276,0.41340882,0.402844,0.48617062,0.37056935,0.30572876,0.3473989,0.32354558,0.36007035,0.357123,0.35375452,0.3903932,0.34531292,0.39225444,Effects of study design in multi-scanner voxel-based morphometry studies,1/1/2014,,Hidemasa Takao; Naoto Hayashi; Kuni Ohtomo,NeuroImage,47,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84884163825&origin=inward,,,,133-140,2014,"@article{,

Accurate classification of these patterns plays a significant role in precise clinical decision making of the extent and nature of the diseases. Therefore, it is important for developing automated pulmonary computer-aided detection systems.

This protocol is time consuming and inhibits fully automatic assessment. In this paper, we present a new method to classify ILD imaging patterns on CT images.

Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal β-amyloid deposition (Aβ+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than Aβ deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with Aβ to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of Aβ pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical Aβ deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by “classic” AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers.

Unfortunately, AD is commonly diagnosed too late, when irreversible damages have been caused in the patient. Objective An automatic, continuous and unobtrusive early AD detection method would be required to improve patients’ life quality and avoid big healthcare costs. Thus, the objective of this survey is to review the multimodal signals that could be used in the development of such a system, emphasizing on the accuracy that they have shown up to date for AD detection. Some useful tools and specific issues towards this goal will also have to be reviewed. Methods An extensive literature review was performed following a specific search strategy, inclusion criteria, data extraction and quality assessment in the Inspec, Compendex and PubMed databases. Results This work reviews the extensive list of psychological, physiological, behavioural and cognitive measurements that could be used for AD detection. The most promising measurements seem to be magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for AD vs control (CTL) discrimination with an 98.95% accuracy, while electroencephalogram (EEG) shows the best results for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs CTL (97.88%) and MCI vs AD distinction (94.05%). Available physiological and behavioural AD datasets are listed, as well as medical imaging analysis steps and neuroimaging processing toolboxes. Some issues such as “label noise” and multi-site data are discussed. Conclusions The development of an unobtrusive and transparent AD detection system should be based on a multimodal system in order to take full advantage of all kinds of symptoms, detect even the smallest changes and combine them, so as to detect AD as early as possible.

In this study, we developed a structural MR-based biomarker for in vivo detection of AD using a supervised machine learning approach. Based on an individual’s pattern of brain atrophy a continuous AD score is assigned which measures the similarity with brain atrophy patterns seen in clinical cases of AD. Methods: The underlying statistical model was trained with MR scans of patients and healthy controls from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1 screening). Validation was performed within ADNI-1 and in an independent patient sample from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1). In addition, our analyses included data from a large general population sample of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-Trend). Results: Based on the proposed AD score we were able to differentiate patients from healthy controls in ADNI-1 and OASIS-1 with an accuracy of 89% (AUC = 95%) and 87% (AUC = 93%), respectively. Moreover, we found the AD score to be significantly associated with cognitive functioning as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination in the OASIS-1 sample after correcting for diagnosis, age, sex, age·sex, and total intracranial volume (Cohen’s f2 = 0.13). Additional analyses showed that the prediction accuracy of AD status based on both the AD score and the MMSE score is significantly higher than when using just one of them. In SHIP-Trend we found the AD score to be weakly but significantly associated with a test of verbal memory consisting of an immediate and a delayed word list recall (again after correcting for age, sex, age·sex, and total intracranial volume, Cohen’s f2 = 0.009). This association was mainly driven by the immediate recall performance. Discussion: In summary, our proposed biomarker well differentiated between patients and healthy controls in an independent test sample. It was associated with measures of cognitive functioning both in a patient sample and a general population sample.

Results: The deep-learning time-to-event model predicted individual subjects' progression to AD dementia with a concordance index of 0.762 on 439 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from 6 to 78 months (quartiles: [24, 42, 54]) and a concordance index of 0.781 on 40 Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Aging testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from 18 to 54 months (quartiles: [18, 36, 54]).

These biomarkers have helped to significantly improve early detection and also differentiation of various dementia syndromes. In this study, we systematically applied whole-brain and region-of-interest (ROI) based support vector machine classification separately and on combined information from different imaging modalities to improve the detection and differentiation of different types of dementia. Methods: Patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD: n = 21), with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD: n = 14) and control subjects (n = 13) underwent both [F18]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), together with clinical and behavioral assessment. FDG-PET and MRI data were commonly processed to get a precise overlap of all regions in both modalities. Support vector machine classification was applied with varying parameters separately for both modalities and to combined information obtained from MR and FDG-PET images. ROIs were extracted from comprehensive systematic and quantitative meta-analyses investigating both disorders. Results: Using single-modality whole-brain and ROI information FDG-PET provided highest accuracy rates for both, detection and differentiation of AD and FTLD compared to structural information from MRI. The ROI-based multimodal classification, combining FDG-PET and MRI information, was highly superior to the unimodal approach and to the whole-brain pattern classification. With this method, accuracy rate of up to 92% for the differentiation of the three groups and an accuracy of 94% for the differentiation of AD and FTLD patients was obtained. Conclusion: Accuracy rate obtained using combined information from both imaging modalities is the highest reported up to now for differentiation of both types of dementia. Our results indicate a substantial gain in accuracy using combined FDG-PET and MRI information and suggest the incorporation of such approaches to clinical diagnosis and to differential diagnostic procedures of neurodegenerative disorders. © 2011 Dukart et al.",0.5154067,0.5866878,0.5907461,0.6321508,0.5050158,0.43482772,0.4621795,0.45259193,0.54421145,0.5280052,0.5216237,0.48543912,0.50943524,0.57678986,Combined evaluation of FDG-PET and MRI improves detection and differentiation of dementia,3/28/2011,,Juergen Dukart; Karsten Mueller; Annette Horstmann; Henryk Barthel; Harald E.

The Medical Informatics Platform (MIP) is a distributed e-infrastructure federating large amounts of data coupled with machine-learning (ML) algorithms and statistical models to define the biological signature of the disease. The present study assessed (i) the accuracy of two ML algorithms, i.e., supervised Gradient Boosting (GB) and semi-unsupervised 3C strategy (Categorize, Cluster, Classify—CCC) implemented in the MIP and (ii) their contribution over the standard diagnostic workup. Methods: We examined individuals coming from the MIP installed across 3 Italian memory clinics, including subjects with Normal Cognition (CN, n = 432), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, n = 456), and AD (n = 451). The GB classifier was applied to best discriminate the three diagnostic classes in 1,339 subjects, and the CCC strategy was used to refine the classical disease categories. Four dementia experts provided their diagnostic confidence (DC) of MCI conversion on an independent cohort of 38 patients. DC was based on clinical, neuropsychological, CSF, and structural MRI information and again with addition of the outcome from the MIP tools. Results: The GB algorithm provided a classification accuracy of 85% in a nested 10-fold cross-validation for CN vs. MCI vs. AD discrimination. Accuracy increased to 95% in the holdout validation, with the omission of each Italian clinical cohort out in turn. CCC identified five homogeneous clusters of subjects and 36 biomarkers that represented the disease fingerprint. In the DC assessment, CCC defined six clusters in the MCI population used to train the algorithm and 29 biomarkers to improve patients staging. GB and CCC showed a significant impact, evaluated as +5.99% of increment on physicians' DC. The influence of MIP on DC was rated from “slight” to “significant” in 80% of the cases. Discussion: GB provided fair results in classification of CN, MCI, and AD. CCC identified homogeneous and promising classes of subjects via its semi-unsupervised approach. We measured the effect of the MIP on the physician's DC. Our results pave the way for the establishment of a new paradigm for ML discrimination of patients who will or will not convert to AD, a clinical priority for neurology.",0.48942178,0.56707376,0.5893567,0.5626121,0.5411459,0.543125,0.49571165,0.4773764,0.5435359,0.50763434,0.5572762,0.51150614,0.5184618,0.55676585,Medical Informatics Platform (MIP): A Pilot Study Across Clinical Italian Cohorts,9/23/2020,,Alberto Redolfi; Silvia De Francesco; Fulvia Palesi; Samantha Galluzzi; Cristina Muscio; Gloria Castellazzi; Pietro Tiraboschi; Giovanni Savini; Anna Nigri; Gabriella Bottini; Maria Grazia Bruzzone; Matteo Cotta Ramusino; Stefania Ferraro; Claudia A.M.

The authors, thus, reviewed recent literature on the theme in order to provide the clinician with an updated overview, intended to support decision-making on aspects of diagnosis and management. This article begins to focus on the concept of AD and on its pathogenesis. Afterward, epidemiology and non-genetic risk factors are approached. Genetics, including genetic risk factors and guidelines for genetic testing, are mentioned next. Recommendations for diagnosis of AD, including recently proposed criteria, are then reviewed. Data on the variants of AD is presented. First approach to the patient is dealt with next, followed by neuropsychological evaluation. Biomarkers, namely magnetic resonance imaging, single photon emission tomography, FDG PET, PiB PET, CSF tau, and Aβ analysis, as well as available data on their diagnostic accuracy, are also discussed. Factors predicting rate of disease progression are briefly mentioned.

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).",0.26052186,0.33267206,0.3077356,0.32120076,0.26515198,0.22714354,0.30403635,0.28576964,0.2879065,0.29747674,0.3032696,0.30039883,0.27996406,0.37293953,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

In this work, we investigated the effects that imaging gradient non-linearity have on reproducibility of multi-site human MRI. We applied an image distortion correction method based on spherical harmonics description of the gradients and verified the accuracy of the method using phantom data. The correction method was then applied to the brain image data from a group of subjects scanned twice at multiple sites having different 1.5 T platforms. Within-site and across-site variability of the image data was assessed by evaluating voxel-based image intensity reproducibility. The image intensity reproducibility of the human brain data was significantly improved with distortion correction, suggesting that this method may offer improved reproducibility in morphometry studies.

Given a set of longitudinal images from different subjects, the task of longitudinal atlas construction is to build an atlas sequence which can represent the trend of anatomical changes of the population. The major challenge for longitudinal atlas construction is how to effectively incorporate both the subject-specific information and population information to build the unbiased atlases. In this paper, a novel groupwise longitudinal atlas construction framework is proposed to address this challenge, and the main contributions of the proposed framework lie in the following aspects: (1) The subject-specific longitudinal information is captured by building the growth model for each subject. (2) The longitudinal atlas sequence is constructed by performing groupwise registration among all the subject image sequences, and only one transformation is needed to transform each subject's image sequence to the atlas space. The constructed longitudinal atlases are unbiased and no explicit template is assumed. (3) The proposed method is general, where the number of longitudinal images of each subject and the time points at which they are taken can be different. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on two longitudinal databases, namely the BLSA and ADNI databases, to construct the longitudinal atlas sequence. It is also compared with a state-of-the-art longitudinal atlas construction algorithm based on kernel regression on the temporal domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves higher registration accuracies and more consistent spatial-temporal correspondences than the compared method on both databases. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0.3542124,0.4235612,0.38419428,0.37891808,0.3783833,0.33089095,0.32514971,0.31620285,0.33533227,0.37116483,0.34059972,0.37713015,0.36479214,0.42296737,A novel framework for longitudinal atlas construction with groupwise registration of subject image sequences,1/16/2012,,Shu Liao; Hongjun Jia; Guorong Wu; Dinggang Shen,NeuroImage,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=83055188093&origin=inward,,,,1275-1289,2012,"@article{,

They provide the means to decode and characterize task relevant brain states and to distinguish them from non-informative brain signals. While undoubtedly this machinery has helped to gain novel biological insights, it also holds the danger of potential unintentional abuse. Ideally machine learning techniques should be usable for any non-expert, however, unfortunately they are typically not. Overfitting and other pitfalls may occur and lead to spurious and nonsensical interpretation.

However, most existing methods extract features by seed-based correlation, which not only requires prior information but also ignores the relationship between resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) voxels. In this study, we proposed a deep learning classification framework with multivariate data-driven based feature extraction for automatic diagnosis of AD. Specifically, a three-level hierarchical partner matching independent components analysis (3LHPM-ICA) approach was proposed first in order to address the issues in spatial individual ICA, including the uncertainty of the numbers of components, the randomness of initial values, and the correspondence of ICs of multiple subjects, resulting in stable and reliable ICs which were applied as the intrinsic brain functional connectivity (FC) features. Second, Granger causality (GC) was utilized to infer directional interaction between the ICs that were identified by the 3LHPM-ICA method and extract the effective connectivity features. Finally, a deep learning classification framework was developed to distinguish AD from controls by fusing the functional and effective connectivities. A resting state fMRI dataset containing 34 AD patients and 34 normal controls (NCs) was applied to the multivariate deep learning platform, leading to a classification accuracy of 95.59%, with a sensitivity of 97.06% and a specificity of 94.12% with leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). The experimental results demonstrated that the measures of neural connectivities of ICA and GC followed by deep learning classification represented the most powerful methods of distinguishing AD clinical data from NCs, and these aberrant brain connectivities might serve as robust brain biomarkers for AD. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to classify other psychiatric disorders.",0.5520224,0.56498545,0.5830957,0.5670865,0.5412041,0.5053097,0.51870835,0.5184968,0.52838784,0.56879747,0.58485043,0.5386253,0.5972956,0.59946454,Multivariate Deep Learning Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Based on Hierarchical Partner Matching Independent Component Analysis,12/17/2018,,Jianping Qiao; Yingru Lv; Chongfeng Cao; Zhishun Wang; Anning Li,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85076258031&origin=inward,,,,,2018,"@article{,

Assuming a prior division of the voxels into non overlapping groups (defined by an atlas), we propose several procedures to derive group importances from individual voxel importances derived from Random Forests models. We then adapt several permutation schemes to turn group importance scores into more interpretable statistical scores that allow to determine the truly relevant groups in the importance rankings.

Its use has historically been focused on single modal data. Attempts to improve prediction and mimic the multimodal nature of clinical expert decision-making has been met in the biomedical field of machine learning by fusing disparate data. This review was conducted to summarize the current studies in this field and identify topics ripe for future research. We conducted this review in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews to characterize multi-modal data fusion in health. Search strings were established and used in databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEEXplore from 2011 to 2021. A final set of 128 articles were included in the analysis. The most common health areas utilizing multi-modal methods were neurology and oncology. Early fusion was the most common data merging strategy. Notably, there was an improvement in predictive performance when using data fusion. Lacking from the papers were clear clinical deployment strategies, FDA-approval, and analysis of how using multimodal approaches from diverse sub-populations may improve biases and healthcare disparities. These findings provide a summary on multimodal data fusion as applied to health diagnosis/prognosis problems. Few papers compared the outputs of a multimodal approach with a unimodal prediction.

The conventional low-order FCNs are obtained by time-series correlation of the whole brain based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI). However, FCNs overlook inter-region interactions, which limits application to brain disease diagnosis. To overcome this drawback, we develop a novel framework to exploit the high-level dynamic interactions among brain regions for early AD diagnosis. Specifically, a sliding window approach is employed to generate some R-fMRI sub-series. The correlations among these sub-series are then used to construct a series of dynamic FCNs. High-order FCNs based on the topographical similarity between each pair of the dynamic FCNs are then constructed. Afterward, a local weight clustering method is used to extract effective features of the network, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation method is chosen for feature selection. A support vector machine is employed for classification, and the dynamic high-order network approach is evaluated on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.

To address is limitation, we develop a novel domain transfer learning method for MCI conversion prediction, which can use data from both the target domain (i.e., MCI) and auxiliary domains (i.e., AD and NC). Specifically, the proposed method consists of three key components: 1) a domain transfer feature selection component that selects the most informative feature-subset from both target domain and auxiliary domains from different imaging modalities; 2) a domain transfer sample selection component that selects the most informative sample-subset from the same target and auxiliary domains from different data modalities; and 3) a domain transfer support vector machine classification component that fuses the selected features and samples to separate MCI-C and MCI-NC patients.

Previous studies have mostly focused on categorical discrimination of patients and matched healthy controls and more recently, on prediction of individual continuous variables such as clinical scores or age. However, these studies are greatly hampered by the large number of predictor variables (voxels) and low observations (subjects) also known as the curse-of-dimensionality or small-n-large-p problem. As a result, feature reduction techniques such as feature subset selection and dimensionality reduction are used to remove redundant predictor variables and experimental noise, a process which mitigates the curse-of-dimensionality and small-n-large-p effects.

In this paper, we propose to use a multiple instance learning (MIL) method in an application for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In our work, local intensity patches are extracted as features. However, not all the patches extracted from patients with dementia are equally affected by the disease and some of them may not be characteristic of morphology associated with the disease. Therefore, there is some ambiguity in assigning disease labels to these patches. The problem of the ambiguous training labels can be addressed by weakly supervised learning techniques such as MIL. A graph is built for each image to exploit the relationships among the patches and then to solve the MIL problem. The constructed graphs contain information about the appearances of patches and the relationships among them, which can reflect the inherent structures of images and aids the classification. Using the baseline MR images of 834 subjects from the ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 89% between AD patients and healthy controls, and 70% between patients defined as stable MCI and progressive MCI in a leave-one-out cross validation.

A framework to learn a joint low-dimensional representation of brain MR images, acquired either at 1.5 or 3 Tesla, is proposed. In this manifold subspace, knowledge can be shared and transfered between the two distinct but related datasets. The joint manifold subspace is built using an adaptation of Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) from a data-driven region of interest (ROI). The ROI is learned using sparse regression to perform simultaneous variable selection at multiple levels of alignment to the MNI152 template. Additionally, a stability selection re-sampling scheme is used to reduce sampling bias while learning the ROI. Knowledge about the intrinsic embedding coordinates of different instances, common to both feature spaces, is used to constrain their alignment in the joint manifold. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) classification results obtained with the proposed approach are presented using data from more than 1500 subjects from ADNI-1, ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 datasets. Results calculated using the learned joint manifold in general outperform those obtained in each independent manifold. Accuracies calculated on ADNI-1 are comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches. To our knowledge, classification accuracies have not been reported before on the complete ADNI (-1, -GO and -2) cohort combined.",0.5169234,0.5890736,0.58352095,0.57480496,0.55808204,0.42960864,0.5220669,0.5177605,0.5078886,0.51549834,0.5148776,0.5179712,0.51132244,0.572206,Manifold alignment and transfer learning for classification of alzheimer’s disease,1/1/2014,,Ricardo Guerrero; Christian Ledig; Daniel Rueckert,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),33,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84921739238&origin=inward,,,,77-84,2014,"@article{,

In the present work, a recently proposed filter for random noise removal is analyzed and adapted to reduce this noise in MR magnitude images. This parametric filter, named Non-Local Means (NLM), is highly dependent on the setting of its parameters. The aim of this paper is to find the optimal parameter selection for MR magnitude image denoising. For this purpose, experiments have been conducted to find the optimum parameters for different noise levels. Besides, the filter has been adapted to fit with specific characteristics of the noise in MR image magnitude images (i.e. Rician noise).

Due to their complementary nature, their combination can provide more accurate AD diagnosis or prognosis. In this work, we apply a multi-modal imaging machine-learning framework to enhance AD classification and prediction of diagnosis of subject-matched gray matter MRI and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET data related to 58 AD, 108 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 120 healthy elderly (HE) subjects from the Australian imaging, biomarkers and lifestyle (AIBL) dataset. Specifically, we combined a Dartel algorithm to enhance anatomical registration with multi-kernel learning (MKL) technique, yielding an average of >95% accuracy for three binary classification problems: AD-vs.-HE, MCI-vs.-HE and AD-vs.-MCI, a considerable improvement from individual modality approach. Consistent with t-contrasts, the MKL weight maps revealed known brain regions associated with AD, i.e., (para)hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral temporal gyrus. Importantly, MKL regression analysis provided excellent predictions of diagnosis of individuals by r2 = 0.86. In addition, we found significant correlations between the MKL classification and delayed memory recall scores with r2 = 0.62 (p < 0.01). Interestingly, outliers in the regression model for diagnosis were mainly converter samples with a higher likelihood of converting to the inclined diagnostic category. Overall, our work demonstrates the successful application of MKL with Dartel on combined neuromarkers from different neuroimaging modalities in the AIBL data. This lends further support in favor of machine learning approach in improving the diagnosis and risk prediction of AD.",0.57368904,0.67652863,0.67782515,0.75828904,0.57340574,0.51242685,0.53236604,0.52037215,0.5715114,0.59806615,0.58495027,0.5603367,0.55703586,0.619813,Multi-kernel learning with dartel improves combined MRI-PET classification of Alzheimer’s disease in AIBL data: Group and individual analyses,7/25/2017,,Vahab Youssofzadeh; Bernadette McGuinness; Liam P.

Quantitative analysis requires the accurate and reproducible labeling of all voxels in any given structure within the brain. Since manual labeling is prohibitively time-consuming and error-prone we have designed an automated procedure called ANIMAL (Automatic Nonlinear Image Matching and Anatomical Labeling) to objectively segment gross anatomical structures from 3D MRIs of normal brains. The procedure is based on nonlinear registration with a previously labeled target brain, followed by numerical inverse transformation of the labels to the native MRI space. Besides segmentation, ANIMAL has been applied to non-rigid registration and to the analysis of morphometric variability. In this paper, the nonlinear registration approach is validated on five test volumes, produced with simulated deformations. Experiments show that the ANIMAL recovers 64% of the nonlinear residual variability remaining after linear registration. Segmentations of the same test data are presented as well. The paper concludes with two applications of ANIMAL using real data. In the first, one MRI volume is nonlinearly matched to a second and is automatically segmented using labels, predefined on the second MRI volume. The automatic segmentation compares well with manual labeling of the same structures. In the second application, ANIMAL is applied to seventeen MRI data sets, and a 3D map of anatomical variability estimates is produced. The automatic variability estimates correlate well (r = 0.867, p = 0.01) with manual estimates of inter-subject variability.",0.38890845,0.40035105,0.38289756,0.42669174,0.32639426,0.30279303,0.31723323,0.30907446,0.34260684,0.36639506,0.3368888,0.3578232,0.3513265,0.48166022,Animal: Validation and application of nonlinear registration-based segmentation,1/1/1997,,D.

Improving classification of AD patients based on MRI scans might help to identify AD earlier in the disease's progress, which may be key in developing treatments for AD. In this study we used an elastic net classifier based on several measures derived from the MRI scans of mild to moderate AD patients (N = 77) from the prospective registry on dementia study and controls (N = 173) from the Austrian Stroke Prevention Family Study. We based our classification on measures from anatomical MRI, diffusion weighted MRI and resting state functional MRI. Our unimodal classification performance ranged from an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.760 (full correlations between functional networks) to 0.909 (grey matter density). When combining measures from multiple modalities in a stepwise manner, the classification performance improved to an AUC of 0.952. This optimal combination consisted of grey matter density, white matter density, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and sparse partial correlations between functional networks. Classification performance for mild AD as well as moderate AD also improved when using this multimodal combination.

This analysis may be a sharp visual analysis by an experienced medical professional or by a computer aided diagnosis system that can help to predict, what may be the recent condition. Similarly, on the basis of various information and technique, a system can be designed to detect whether a patient is prone to Alzheimer's disease or not. And this task of detection of abnormalities at an initial stage from brain MRI is a major challenge in the field of neurosciences. The main idea behind our research is to utilize the deep layers feature extraction benefited from deep neural network architecture, without extensive hardware resource training, and classifying the image on a basis of simple machine-learning algorithm with selected best features in order to reduce work load, classification error and hardware utilization time. We have utilized convolution neural network (CNN) layer using similar architecture like that of Alexnet with some parametric change, for the automatic extraction of features of images obtained from slice extraction of whole brain MRI whereas 13 manual features based on gray level co-occurrence matrix were also extracted to test the impact of this features on ranking. If we had only classified using CNN network, the misclassification rate was much higher. So, feature selection is achieved with feature ranking algorithms like Mutinffs, ReliefF, Laplacian and UDFS and so on and also tested with different machine-learning techniques like Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Subspace Ensemble under different testing condition.

Focused on providing an earlier and more accurate diagnosis, sophisticated MRI machine learning algorithms have been developed over the recent years, most of them learning their non-disease patterns from MCI that remained stable over 2–3 years. In this work, we analyzed whether these stable MCI over short-term periods are actually appropriate training examples of non-disease patterns. To this aim, we compared the diagnosis of MCI patients at 2 and 5 years of follow-up and investigated its impact on the predictive performance of baseline volumetric MRI measures primarily involved in AD, i.e., hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes. Predictive power was evaluated in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in a trial sample of 248 MCI patients followed-up over 5 years. We further compared the sensitivity in those MCI that converted before 2 years and those that converted after 2 years. Our results indicate that 23% of the stable MCI at 2 years progressed in the next three years and that MRI volumetric measures are good predictors of conversion to AD dementia even at the mid-term, showing a better specificity and AUC as follow-up time increases. The combination of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex yielded an AUC that was significantly higher for the 5-year follow-up (AUC = 73% at 2 years vs. AUC = 84% at 5 years), as well as for specificity (56% vs. 71%). Sensitivity showed a non-significant slight decrease (81% vs. 78%). Remarkably, the performance of this model was comparable to machine learning models at the same follow-up times. MRI correctly identified most of the patients that converted after 2 years (with sensitivity >60%), and these patients showed a similar degree of abnormalities to those that converted before 2 years. This implies that most of the MCI patients that remained stable over short periods and subsequently progressed to AD dementia had evident atrophies at baseline. Therefore, machine learning models that use these patients to learn non-disease patterns are including an important fraction of patients with evident pathological changes related to the disease, something that might result in reduced performance and lack of biological interpretability.",0.51098955,0.5602842,0.548088,0.57886755,0.52441245,0.49947432,0.50368524,0.48585948,0.546546,0.5166881,0.54112095,0.50589865,0.5257881,0.5674451,Prediction of Alzheimer's disease dementia with MRI beyond the short-term: Implications for the design of predictive models,1/1/2019,,Alexis Moscoso; Jesús Silva-Rodríguez; Jose Manuel Aldrey; Julia Cortés; Anxo Fernández-Ferreiro; Noemí Gómez-Lado; Álvaro Ruibal; Pablo Aguiar,NeuroImage: Clinical,38,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065229722&origin=inward,,,,,2019,"@article{,

This paper describes a novel method for learning the manifold of 3D brain images that, unlike most existing manifold learning methods, does not require the manifold space to be locally linear, and does not require a predefined similarity measure or a prebuilt proximity graph. Our manifold learning method is based on deep learning, a machine learning approach that uses layered networks (called deep belief networks, or DBNs) and has received much attention recently in the computer vision field due to their success in object recognition tasks. DBNs have traditionally been too computationally expensive for application to 3D images due to the large number of trainable parameters. Our primary contributions are 1) a much more computationally efficient training method for DBNs that makes training on 3D medical images with a resolution of up to 128 x 128 x 128 practical, and 2) the demonstration that DBNs can learn a low-dimensional manifold of brain volumes that detects modes of variations that correlate to demographic and disease parameters. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",0.4354299,0.49153227,0.42440537,0.42074093,0.41300973,0.34646448,0.37688994,0.3738673,0.35406545,0.43193084,0.43561438,0.45519403,0.42966545,0.5213919,Manifold learning of brain MRIs by deep learning,10/24/2013,,Tom Brosch; Roger Tam,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),171,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897570416&origin=inward,,,,633-640,2013,"@article{,

In this work, we try a new exploratory data analysis of AD based on deep convolutional autoencoders. We aim at finding links between cognitive symptoms and the underlying neurodegeneration process by fusing the information of neuropsychological test outcomes, diagnoses, and other clinical data with the imaging features extracted solely via a data-driven decomposition of MRI. The distribution of the extracted features in different combinations is then analyzed and visualized using regression and classification analysis, and the influence of each coordinate of the autoencoder manifold over the brain is estimated.

Recently, rather than predicting categorical variables as in classification, several pattern regression methods have also been used to estimate continuous clinical variables from brain images. However, most existing regression methods focus on estimating multiple clinical variables separately and thus cannot utilize the intrinsic useful correlation information among different clinical variables. On the other hand, in those regression methods, only a single modality of data (usually only the structural MRI) is often used, without considering the complementary information that can be provided by different modalities. In this paper, we propose a general methodology, namely multi-modal multi-task (M3T) learning, to jointly predict multiple variables from multi-modal data. Here, the variables include not only the clinical variables used for regression but also the categorical variable used for classification, with different tasks corresponding to prediction of different variables. Specifically, our method contains two key components, i.e., (1) a multi-task feature selection which selects the common subset of relevant features for multiple variables from each modality, and (2) a multi-modal support vector machine which fuses the above-selected features from all modalities to predict multiple (regression and classification) variables. To validate our method, we perform two sets of experiments on ADNI baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data from 45 AD patients, 91 MCI patients, and 50 healthy controls (HC). In the first set of experiments, we estimate two clinical variables such as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), as well as one categorical variable (with value of 'AD', 'MCI' or 'HC'), from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data.

For example, in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases eligible for the study are nearly two times the Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients for structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality and six times the control cases for proteomics modality. Constructing an accurate classifier from imbalanced data is a challenging task. Traditional classifiers that aim to maximize the overall prediction accuracy tend to classify all data into the majority class. In this paper, we study an ensemble system of feature selection and data sampling for the class imbalance problem. We systematically analyze various sampling techniques by examining the efficacy of different rates and types of undersampling, oversampling, and a combination of over and undersampling approaches. We thoroughly examine six widely used feature selection algorithms to identify significant biomarkers and thereby reduce the complexity of the data. The efficacy of the ensemble techniques is evaluated using two different classifiers including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines based on classification accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity measures. Our extensive experimental results show that for various problem settings in ADNI, (1) a balanced training set obtained with K-Medoids technique based undersampling gives the best overall performance among different data sampling techniques and no sampling approach; and (2) sparse logistic regression with stability selection achieves competitive performance among various feature selection algorithms. Comprehensive experiments with various settings show that our proposed ensemble model of multiple undersampled datasets yields stable and promising results. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",0.49283803,0.6227323,0.54777724,0.54745555,0.533853,0.47812486,0.5010532,0.49618235,0.53308123,0.53001744,0.5538209,0.5647886,0.5089386,0.56815696,Analysis of sampling techniques for imbalanced data: An n=648 ADNI study,2/15/2014,,Rashmi Dubey; Jiayu Zhou; Yalin Wang; Paul M.

Several segmentation methods to diagnose AD have been proposed with varying complexity. Segmentation of the brain structure and classification of AD using deep learning approaches has gained attention as it can provide effective results over a large set of data. Hence, deep learning methods are now preferred over state-of-the-art machine learning methods. We aim to provide an outline of current deep learning-based segmentation approaches for the quantitative analysis of brain MRI for the diagnosis of AD. Here, we report how convolutional neural network architectures are used to analyze the anatomical brain structure and diagnose AD, discuss how brain MRI segmentation improves AD classification, describe the stateof-the-art approaches, and summarize their results using publicly available datasets.

Large longitudinal MRI datasets have revealed such deterioration, in part, by applying machine and deep learning to predict diagnosis. A popular approach is to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract informative features from each visit of the longitudinal MRI and then use those features to classify each visit via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Such modeling neglects the progressive nature of the disease, which may result in clinically implausible classifications across visits. To avoid this issue, we propose to combine features across visits by coupling feature extraction with a novel longitudinal pooling layer and enforce consistency of the classification across visits in line with disease progression. We evaluate the proposed method on the longitudinal structural MRIs from three neuroimaging datasets: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=404), a dataset composed of 274 normal controls and 329 patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and 255 youths from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA).

To determine the relative strengths of different approaches to analyzing structural MR data to distinguish people with VMD from normal elderly control subjects, we evaluated seven different classification approaches, each of which we used to generate a diagnostic model from a training data set acquired from 83 subjects (33 VMD and 50 control).

Among them, independent component analysis (ICA) is arguably the most widely used for identifying functional networks, and its success has led to a number of versatile extensions to group and multimodal data. However there are indications that ICA may have reached a limit in flexibility and representational capacity, as the majority of such extensions are case-driven, custom-made solutions that are still contained within the class of mixture models. In this work, we seek out a principled and naturally extensible approach and consider a probabilistic model known as a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). An RBM separates linear factors from functional brain imaging data by fitting a probability distribution model to the data. Importantly, the solution can be used as a building block for more complex (deep) models, making it naturally suitable for hierarchical and multimodal extensions that are not easily captured when using linear factorizations alone. We investigate the capability of RBMs to identify intrinsic networks and compare its performance to that of well-known linear mixture models, in particular ICA. Using synthetic and real task fMRI data, we show that RBMs can be used to identify networks and their temporal activations with accuracy that is equal or greater than that of factorization models. The demonstrated effectiveness of RBMs supports its use as a building block for deeper models, a significant prospect for future neuroimaging research. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",0.3740003,0.41706517,0.4114745,0.4367128,0.34320247,0.29244563,0.3145013,0.3050054,0.32624945,0.39520174,0.36129636,0.39374945,0.38301802,0.41987053,Restricted Boltzmann machines for neuroimaging: An application in identifying intrinsic networks,8/1/2014,,R.

When applying machine learning, obtaining ground-truth labels for supervised learning is more difficult than in many more common applications of machine learning. This is especially so for datasets with abnormalities, as tissue types and the shapes of the organs in these datasets differ widely. However, organ detection in such an abnormal dataset may have many promising potential real-world applications, such as automatic diagnosis, automated radiotherapy planning, and medical image retrieval, where new multimodal medical images provide more information about the imaged tissues for diagnosis. Here, we test the application of deep learning methods to organ identification in magnetic resonance medical images, with visual and temporal hierarchical features learned to categorize object classes from an unlabeled multimodal DCE-MRI dataset so that only a weakly supervised training is required for a classifier. A probabilistic patch-based method was employed for multiple organ detection, with the features learned from the deep learning model.

Since there is no effective treatment for AD, it is extremely important to diagnose MCI as early as possible, as this makes it possible to delay its progression toward AD. However, it's challenging to identify early MCI (EMCI) because there are only mild changes in the brain structures of patients compared with a normal control (NC). To extract remarkable features for these mild changes, in this paper, a multi-modality diagnosis approach based on deep learning is presented. Firstly, we propose to use structure MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images as the multi-modality data to identify EMCI. Then, a convolutional neural network based on transfer learning technique is developed to extract features of the multi-modality data, where an L1-norm is introduced to reduce the feature dimensionality and retrieve essential features for the identification. At last, the classifier produces 94.2% accuracy for EMCI vs. NC on an ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that multi-modality data can provide more useful information to distinguish EMCI from NC compared with single modality data, and the proposed method can improve classification performance, which is beneficial to early intervention of AD.

Recent emergence of advanced network analysis techniques utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) has made the understanding of neurological disorders more comprehensively at a whole-brain connectivity level. However, inferring effective brain connectivity from fMRI data is a challenging task, particularly when the ultimate goal is to obtain good control-patient classification performance. Incorporating sparsity into connectivity modeling can potentially produce results that are biologically more meaningful since most biologically networks are formed by a relatively few number of connections. However, this constraint, when applied at an individual level, will degrade classification performance due to inter-subject variability. To address this problem, we consider a constrained sparse linear regression model associated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Specifically, we introduced sparsity into brain connectivity via l1-norm penalization, and ensured consistent non-zero connections across subjects via l2-norm penalization.

First, MRI images are prepared with age-correction and other processing. Second, local patches, which are assembled into 2.5 dimensions, are extracted from these images.

Global GM volume was assessed using segmentation and local GM volume was assessed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM); VBM was optimized for template mismatch and statistical mass. AD subjects had significantly (12.3%) lower mean global GM volume when compared to controls (517 ± 58 vs. 590 ± 52 ml; P < 0.001).

The samples were shuffled and subject-level training and testing datasets were completely independent. The optimized MCADNNet was trained and extracted invariant and hierarchical features through convolutional layers followed by multi-classification in the last layer using a softmax layer.

However, finding a good representation for multivariate brain MRI features in which their essential structure is revealed and easily extractable has been difficult. We report a successful application of a machine learning framework that significantly improved the use of brain MRI for predictions. Specifically, we used the unsupervised learning algorithm of local linear embedding (LLE) to transform multivariate MRI data of regional brain volume and cortical thickness to a locally linear space with fewer dimensions, while also utilizing the global nonlinear data structure. The embedded brain features were then used to train a classifier for predicting future conversion to AD based on a baseline MRI. We tested the approach on 413 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had baseline MRI scans and complete clinical follow-ups over 3. years with the following diagnoses: cognitive normal (CN; n. = 137), stable mild cognitive impairment (s-MCI; n. = 93), MCI converters to AD (c-MCI, n. = 97), and AD (n. = 86). We found that classifications using embedded MRI features generally outperformed (p. <. 0.05) classifications using the original features directly. Moreover, the improvement from LLE was not limited to a particular classifier but worked equally well for regularized logistic regressions, support vector machines, and linear discriminant analysis. Most strikingly, using LLE significantly improved (p. = 0.007) predictions of MCI subjects who converted to AD and those who remained stable (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: = 0.68/0.80/0.56). In contrast, predictions using the original features performed not better than by chance (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: = 0.56/0.65/0.46). In conclusion, LLE is a very effective tool for classification studies of AD using multivariate MRI data. The improvement in predicting conversion to AD in MCI could have important implications for health management and for powering therapeutic trials by targeting non-demented subjects who later convert to AD. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",0.5684624,0.6293864,0.5962035,0.55899805,0.56832117,0.4775191,0.51908654,0.50636137,0.55129516,0.5599874,0.5661777,0.5569414,0.5509733,0.60798055,Locally linear embedding (LLE) for MRI based Alzheimer's disease classification,12/1/2013,,Xin Liu; Duygu Tosun; Michael W.

Traditional association studies typically perform independent and pairwise analysis among neuroimaging measures, cognitive scores and disease status, and ignore the important underlying interacting relationships between these units. Results: To overcome this limitation, in this article, we propose a new sparse multimodal multitask learning method to reveal complex relationships from gene to brain to symptom. Our main contributions are three-fold: (i) introducing combined structured sparsity regularizations into multimodal multitask learning to integrate multidimensional heterogeneous imaging genetics data and identify multimodal biomarkers; (ii) utilizing a joint classification and regression learning model to identify disease-sensitive and cognition-relevant biomarkers; (iii) deriving a new efficient optimization algorithm to solve our non-smooth objective function and providing rigorous theoretical analysis on the global optimum convergency. Using the imaging genetics data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by clearly improved performance on predicting both cognitive scores and disease status. The identified multimodal biomarkers could predict not only disease status but also cognitive function to help elucidate the biological pathway from gene to brain structure and function, and to cognition and disease. © The Author(s) 2012.

Therefore, diagnosis of AD has been mostly performed by analyzing brain images such as magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological tests. Identifying the molecular-level mechanism of AD has been lacking data owing to the difficulty of sampling in the posterior brains of normal and AD patients; however, recent studies have produced and analyzed large-scale omics data for brain areas such as prefrontal cortex. Therefore, it is necessary to develop AD diagnosis or prediction methods based on these data. Results: This paper proposed a deep learning-based model that can predict AD using large-scale gene expression and DNA methylation data. The most challenging problem in constructing a model to diagnose AD based on the multi-omics dataset is how to integrate different omics data and how to deal with high-dimensional and low-sample-size data. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel but simple approach to reduce the number of features based on a differentially expressed gene and a differentially methylated position in the multi-omics dataset. Moreover, we developed a deep neural network-based prediction model that improves performance compared to that of conventional machine learning algorithms. The feature selection method and the prediction model presented in this paper outperformed conventional machine learning algorithms, which utilize typical dimension reduction methods. In addition, we demonstrated that integrating gene expression and DNA methylation data could improve the prediction accuracy.

Compared with traditional single-atlas based methods, multiatlas based methods adopt multiple predefined atlases and thus are less biased by a certain atlas. However, most existing multiatlas based methods simply average or concatenate the features from multiple atlases, which may ignore the potentially important diagnosis information related to the anatomical differences among different atlases. In this paper, we propose a novel view (i.e., atlas) centralized multi-atlas classification method, which can better exploit useful information in multiple feature representations from different atlases. Specifically, all brain images are registered onto multiple atlases individually, to extract feature representations in each atlas space. Then, the proposed view-centralized multi-atlas feature selection method is used to select the most discriminative features from each atlas with extra guidance from other atlases. Next, we design a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using the selected features in each atlas space. Finally, we combine multiple SVM classifiers for multiple atlases through a classifier ensemble strategy for making a final decision. We have evaluated our method on 459 subjects [including 97 AD, 117 progressive MCI (p-MCI), 117 stable MCI (s-MCI), and 128 normal controls (NC)] from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, and achieved an accuracy of 92.51% for AD versus NC classification and an accuracy of 78.88% for p-MCI versus s-MCI classification.

However, to the best of our knowledge, most existing methods focus on mining the relationship across multiple modalities of the same subjects, while ignoring the potentially useful relationship across different subjects. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel learning method for multimodal classification of AD/MCI, by fully exploring the relationships across both modalities and subjects. Specifically, our proposed method includes two subsequent components, i.e., label-aligned multi-task feature selection and multimodal classification. In the first step, the feature selection learning from multiple modalities are treated as different learning tasks and a group sparsity regularizer is imposed to jointly select a subset of relevant features. Furthermore, to utilize the discriminative information among labeled subjects, a new label-aligned regularization term is added into the objective function of standard multi-task feature selection, where label-alignment means that all multi-modality subjects with the same class labels should be closer in the new feature-reduced space.

In this paper, we consider the integration of high-dimensional multi-modality imaging and genetic data for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. With a focus on taking advantage of both phenotype and genotype information, a novel structured sparsity, defined by ℓ1, p-norm (p > 1), regularized multiple kernel learning method is designed. Specifically, to facilitate structured feature selection and fusion from heterogeneous modalities and also capture feature-wise importance, we represent each feature with a distinct kernel as a basis, followed by grouping the kernels according to modalities. Then, an optimally combined kernel presentation of multimodal features is learned in a data-driven approach. Contrary to the Group Lasso (i.e., ℓ2, 1-norm penalty) which performs sparse group selection, the proposed regularizer enforced on kernel weights is to sparselyselect concise feature set within each homogenous group and fuse the heterogeneous feature groups by taking advantage of dense norms.

However, most such instances have been limited to pair-wise fusion; because there are often more than two imaging modalities available per subject, there is a need for approaches that can combine multiple datasets optimally. In this paper, we extended our previous two-way fusion model called ""multimodal CCA + joint ICA"", to three or N-way fusion, that enables robust identification of correspondence among N data types and allows one to investigate the important question of whether certain disease risk factors are shared or distinct across multiple modalities. We compared ""mCCA + jICA"" with its alternatives in a 3-way fusion simulation and verified its advantages in both decomposition accuracy and modal linkage detection. We also applied it to real functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)-Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and structural MRI fusion to elucidate the abnormal architecture underlying schizophrenia (n = 97) relative to healthy controls (n = 116). Both modality-common and modality-unique abnormal regions were identified in schizophrenia. Specifically, the visual cortex in fMRI, the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and forceps minor in DTI, and the parietal lobule, cuneus and thalamus in sMRI were linked and discriminated between patients and controls. One fMRI component with regions of activity in motor cortex and superior temporal gyrus individually discriminated schizophrenia from controls. Finally, three components showed significant correlation with duration of illness (DOI), suggesting that lower gray matter volumes in parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes and cerebellum are associated with increased DOI, along with white matter disruption in ATR and cortico-spinal tracts. Findings suggest that the identified fractional anisotropy changes may relate to the corresponding functional/structural changes in the brain that are thought to play a role in the clinical expression of schizophrenia.

Multimodal medical fusion assists medical practitioners to visualize the internal organs and tissues. Multimodal medical fusion of brain image helps to medical practitioners to simultaneously visualize hard portion like skull and soft portion like tissue. Brain tumor segmentation can be accurately performed by utilizing the image obtained after multimodal medical image fusion. The area of the tumor can be accurately located with the information obtained from both Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Image in a single fused image. This approach increases the accuracy in diagnosing the tumor and reduces the time consumed in diagnosing and locating the tumor.

Thus, the spatial characteristics and functional information can be obtained from a single image using a robust multimodal medical image fusion model. The proposed approach uses a generative adversarial network to fuse Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Image into a single image. The results obtained from the proposed approach can be used for further medical analysis to locate the tumor and plan for further surgical procedures.

However, in practice, it is unavoidable to have missing data, i.e., missing PET data for many subjects in the ADNI dataset. A straightforward strategy to tackle this challenge is to simply discard subjects with missing PET, but this will significantly reduce the number of training subjects for learning reliable diagnostic models. On the other hand, since different modalities (i.e., MRI and PET) were acquired from the same subject, there often exist underlying relevance between different modalities. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework for AD diagnosis using both MRI and PET data. Specifically, in the first stage, we impute missing PET data based on their corresponding MRI data by using 3D Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (3D-cGAN) to capture their underlying relationship. In the second stage, with the complete MRI and PET (i.e., after imputation for the case of missing PET), we develop a deep multi-instance neural network for AD diagnosis and also mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction.

In real-world applications, the relationships among subjects are much more complex than pairwise, and the high-order structure containing more discriminative information will be intuitively beneficial to our learning tasks.

Recently, multitask feature selection methods are typically used for joint selection of common features across multiple modalities. However, one disadvantage of existing multimodality based methods is that they ignore the useful data distribution information in each modality, which is essential for subsequent classification. Accordingly, in this paper we propose a manifold regularized multitask feature learning method to preserve both the intrinsic relatedness among multiple modalities of data and the data distribution information in each modality. Specifically, we denote the feature learning on each modality as a single task, and use group-sparsity regularizer to capture the intrinsic relatedness among multiple tasks (i.e., modalities) and jointly select the common features from multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new manifold-based Laplacian regularizer to preserve the data distribution information from each task. Finally, we use the multikernel support vector machine method to fuse multimodality data for eventual classification. Conversely, we also extend our method to the semisupervised setting, where only partial data are labeled. We evaluate our method using the baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data of subjects from AD neuroimaging initiative database. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can not only achieve improved classification performance, but also help to discover the disease-related brain regions useful for disease diagnosis.",0.47232258,0.5503134,0.57511955,0.6043708,0.50731504,0.40599924,0.47979864,0.4730723,0.47918534,0.51876056,0.48925745,0.49792176,0.4787736,0.5404303,Manifold regularized multitask feature learning for multimodality disease classification,2/1/2015,,Biao Jie; Daoqiang Zhang; Bo Cheng; Dinggang Shen,Human Brain Mapping,125,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84922322664&origin=inward,,,,489-507,2015,"@article{,

However, effectively integrating multi-modality data remains a challenging problem, especially when the data are incomplete. For instance, more than half of the subjects in the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database have no fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid data. Currently, there are two commonly used strategies to handle the problem of incomplete data: 1) discard samples having missing features; and 2) impute those missing values via specific techniques. In the first case, a significant amount of useful information is lost and, in the second case, additional noise and artifacts might be introduced into the data. Also, previous studies generally focus on the pairwise relationships among subjects, without considering their underlying complex (e.g., high-order) relationships. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-hypergraph learning method for dealing with incomplete multimodality data. Specifically, we first construct multiple hypergraphs to represent the high-order relationships among subjects by dividing them into several groups according to the availability of their data modalities. A hypergraph regularized transductive learning method is then applied to these groups for automatic diagnosis of brain diseases.

However, due to the huge image variability and ambiguity, it is fundamentally challenging to handle the highly complex input-target relationship of multioutput regression, especially with indiscriminate high-dimensional representations. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised descriptor learning (SDL) algorithm for multioutput regression, which can establish discriminative and compact feature representations to improve the multivariate estimation performance. The SDL is formulated as generalized low-rank approximations of matrices with a supervised manifold regularization. The SDL is able to simultaneously extract discriminative features closely related to multivariate targets and remove irrelevant and redundant information by transforming raw features into a new low-dimensional space aligned to targets. The achieved discriminative while compact descriptor largely reduces the variability and ambiguity for multioutput regression, which enables more accurate and efficient multivariate estimation. We conduct extensive evaluation of the proposed SDL on both synthetic data and real-world multioutput regression tasks for both computer vision and medical image analysis. Experimental results have shown that the proposed SDL can achieve high multivariate estimation accuracy on all tasks and largely outperforms the algorithms in the state of the arts.

However, statistical models of biomarkers to predict outcomes in Alzheimer's rarely model nonlinear interactions between these measures. Here, we used Gaussian Processes to address this, modelling nonlinear interactions to predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's over 3 years, using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. Measures included: demographics, APOE4 genotype, CSF (amyloid-β42, total tau, phosphorylated tau), [18F]florbetapir, hippocampal volume and brain-age. We examined: (a) the independent value of each biomarker; and (b) whether modelling nonlinear interactions between biomarkers improved predictions. Each measured added complementary information when predicting conversion to Alzheimer's. A linear model classifying stable from progressive MCI explained over half the variance (R2 = 0.51, p '.001); the strongest independently contributing biomarker was hippocampal volume (R2 = 0.13). When comparing sensitivity of different models to progressive MCI (independent biomarker models, additive models, nonlinear interaction models), we observed a significant improvement (p '.001) for various two-way interaction models. The best performing model included an interaction between amyloid-β-PET and P-tau, while accounting for hippocampal volume (sensitivity = 0.77, AUC = 0.826). Closely related biomarkers contributed uniquely to predict conversion to Alzheimer's. Nonlinear biomarker interactions were also implicated, and results showed that although for some patients adding additional biomarkers may add little value (i.e., when hippocampal volume is high), for others (i.e., with low hippocampal volume) further invasive and expensive examination may be warranted.

In such methods, multiview morphological patterns generated from multiple templates are used as feature representation for brain images. However, existing multitemplate-based methods often simply assume that each class is represented by a specific type of data distribution (i.e., a single cluster), while in reality, the underlying data distribution is actually not preknown. In this paper, we propose an inherent structure-based multiview leaning method using multiple templates for AD/MCI classification. Specifically, we first extract multiview feature representations for subjects using multiple selected templates and then cluster subjects within a specific class into several subclasses (i.e., clusters) in each view space. Then, we encode those subclasses with unique codes by considering both their original class information and their own distribution information, followed by a multitask feature selection model.

This study takes a significant step in this direction. We employed three classes of state-of-the-art MVPA algorithms and common types of structural measurements from brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to predict an array of clinically relevant variables (diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder; age, cerebrospinal fluid derived amyloid-β levels and mini-mental state exam score).

The employed data and computational tools are freely distributed (https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/mripredict), making this the largest, most comprehensive, reproducible benchmark image-based prediction experiment to date in structural neuroimaging. Finally, we make several observations regarding the factors that influence prediction performance and point to future research directions. Unsurprisingly, our results suggest that the biological footprint (effect size) has a dramatic influence on prediction performance. Though the choice of image measurement and MVPA algorithm can impact the result, there was no universally optimal selection.

Researchers and clinicians are also increasingly interested in the study of functional-connectivity patterns of brains at rest and how these relations might change in conditions like Alzheimer's disease or clinical depression. In this study we investigate the efficacy of a specific multivariate statistical machine learning technique to perform patient stratification from functional-connectivity patterns of brains at rest. Whilst the majority of previous approaches to this problem have employed support vector machines (SVMs) we investigate the performance of Bayesian Gaussian process logistic regression (GP-LR) models with linear and non-linear covariance functions. GP-LR models can be interpreted as a Bayesian probabilistic analogue to kernel SVM classifiers. However, GP-LR methods confer a number of benefits over kernel SVMs. Whilst SVMs only return a binary class label prediction, GP-LR, being a probabilistic model, provides a principled estimate of the probability of class membership. Class probability estimates are a measure of the confidence the model has in its predictions, such a confidence score may be extremely useful in the clinical setting. Additionally, if miss-classification costs are not symmetric, thresholds can be set to achieve either strong specificity or sensitivity scores. Since GP-LR models are Bayesian, computationally expensive cross-validation hyper-parameter grid-search methods can be avoided. We apply these methods to a sample of 77 subjects; 27 with a diagnosis of probable AD, 50 with a diagnosis of a-MCI and a control sample of 39. All subjects underwent a MRI examination at 3. T to obtain a 7. minute and 20. second resting state scan. Our results support the hypothesis that GP-LR models can be effective at performing patient stratification: the implemented model achieves 75% accuracy disambiguating healthy subjects from subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment and 97% accuracy disambiguating amnesic mild cognitive impairment subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, accuracies are estimated using a held-out test set.

These may provide complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. We present a multi-modality classification framework in which manifolds are constructed based on pairwise similarity measures derived from random forest classifiers. Similarities from multiple modalities are combined to generate an embedding that simultaneously encodes information about all the available features. Multi-modality classification is then performed using coordinates from this joint embedding. We evaluate the proposed framework by application to neuroimaging and biological data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Features include regional MRI volumes, voxel-based FDG-PET signal intensities, CSF biomarker measures, and categorical genetic information. Classification based on the joint embedding constructed using information from all four modalities out-performs the classification based on any individual modality for comparisons between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, as well as between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. Based on the joint embedding, we achieve classification accuracies of 89% between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, and 75% between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. These results are comparable with those reported in other recent studies using multi-kernel learning. Random forests provide consistent pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities, thus facilitating the combination of different types of feature data. We demonstrate this by application to data in which the number of features differs by several orders of magnitude between modalities. Random forest classifiers extend naturally to multi-class problems, and the framework described here could be applied to distinguish between multiple patient groups in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..",0.546085,0.63542104,0.68497735,0.6619282,0.5386269,0.47022992,0.48423228,0.48249364,0.5468242,0.57243913,0.5273879,0.51498604,0.5306476,0.60977757,Random forest-based similarity measures for multi-modal classification of Alzheimer's disease,1/15/2013,,Katherine R.

Recent studies show that, AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal control (NC) can be distinguished with relatively high accuracy using the baseline cortical thickness. With the increasing availability of large longitudinal datasets, it also becomes possible to study the longitudinal changes of cortical thickness and their correlation with the development of pathology in AD. In this study, the longitudinal cortical thickness changes of 152 subjects from 4 clinical groups (AD, NC, Progressive-MCI and Stable-MCI) selected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are measured by our recently developed 4 D (spatial+temporal) thickness measuring algorithm. It is found that the 4 clinical groups demonstrate very similar spatial distribution of grey matter (GM) loss on cortex. To fully utilize the longitudinal information and better discriminate the subjects from 4 groups, especially between Stable-MCI and Progressive-MCI, 3 different categories of features are extracted for each subject, i.e., (1) static cortical thickness measures computed from the baseline and endline, (2) cortex thinning dynamics, such as the thinning speed (mm/year) and the thinning ratio (endline/baseline), and (3) network features computed from the brain network constructed based on the correlation between the longitudinal thickness changes of different regions of interest (ROIs). By combining the complementary information provided by features from the 3 categories, 2 classifiers are trained to diagnose AD and to predict the conversion to AD in MCI subjects, respectively. In the leave-one-out cross-validation, the proposed method can distinguish AD patients from NC at an accuracy of 96.1%, and can detect 81.7% (AUC = 0.875) of the MCI converters 6 months ahead of their conversions to AD. Also, by analyzing the brain network built via longitudinal cortical thickness changes, a significant decrease (p < 0.02) of the network clustering coefficient (associated with the development of AD pathology) is found in the Progressive-MCI group, which indicates the degenerated wiring efficiency of the brain network due to AD. More interestingly, the decreasing of network clustering coefficient of the olfactory cortex region was also found in the AD patients, which suggests olfactory dysfunction. Although the smell identification test is not performed in ADNI, this finding is consistent with other AD-related olfactory studies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0.5016941,0.51196885,0.53414,0.5211953,0.4979558,0.4740621,0.47688806,0.46547508,0.5397593,0.5279885,0.5209151,0.49426225,0.5253591,0.5491495,Discriminant analysis of longitudinal cortical thickness changes in Alzheimer's disease using dynamic and network features,1/1/2012,,Yang Li; Yaping Wang; Guorong Wu; Feng Shi; Luping Zhou; Weili Lin; Dinggang Shen,Neurobiology of Aging,154,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=82755161873&origin=inward,,,,427.e15-427.e30,2012,"@article{,

Recent widespread adoption of neuroimaging has allowed researchers to study longitudinal data in AD. We adopted cortical thickness and sulcal depth, parameterized by three-dimensional meshes, from magnetic resonance imaging as the surface features. The cortical feature is high-dimensional, and it is difficult to use directly with a classifier because of the ""small sample size"" problem. We applied manifold learning to reduce the dimensionality of the feature and then tested the usage of the dimensionality reduced feature with a support vector machine classifier. Principal component analysis (PCA) was chosen as the method of manifold learning. PCA was applied to a region of interest within the cortical surface. We used 30 normal, 30 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 12 conversion cases taken from the ADNI database. The classifier was trained using the cortical features extracted from normal and MCI patients. The classifier was tested for the 12 conversion patients only using the imaging data before the actual conversion.

Over the past decade, these measures have been increasingly integrated into imaging signatures of AD by means of classification frameworks, offering promising tools for individualized diagnosis and prognosis. We reviewed neuroimaging-based studies for AD and mild cognitive impairment classification, selected after online database searches in Google Scholar and PubMed (January, 1985–June, 2016). We categorized these studies based on the following neuroimaging modalities (and sub-categorized based on features extracted as a post-processing step from these modalities): i) structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] (tissue density, cortical surface, and hippocampal measurements), ii) functional MRI (functional coherence of different brain regions, and the strength of the functional connectivity), iii) diffusion tensor imaging (patterns along the white matter fibers), iv) fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (metabolic rate of cerebral glucose), and v) amyloid-PET (amyloid burden).

Various features have been extracted from the neuroimaging data to characterize the disorders, and these features can be roughly divided into global and local features. Recent studies show a tendency of using local features in disease characterization, since they are capable of identifying the subtle disease-specific patterns associated with the effects of the disease on human brain. However, problems arise if the neuroimaging database involved multiple disorders or progressive disorders, as disorders of different types or at different progressive stages might exhibit different degenerative patterns. It is difficult for the researchers to reach consensus on what brain regions could effectively distinguish multiple disorders or multiple progression stages. In this study we proposed a Multi-Channel pattern analysis approach to identify the most discriminative local brain metabolism features for neurodegenerative disorder characterization. We compared our method to global methods and other pattern analysis methods based on clinical expertise or statistics tests. The preliminary results suggested that the proposed Multi-Channel pattern analysis method outperformed other approaches in Alzheimer's disease characterization, and meanwhile provided important insights into the underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",0.5295168,0.5238538,0.5495128,0.5696638,0.47935075,0.46185982,0.42803034,0.40959746,0.5204443,0.5208047,0.50639844,0.51637644,0.5041078,0.53335106,Multi-Channel neurodegenerative pattern analysis and its application in Alzheimer's disease characterization,1/1/2014,,Sidong Liu; Weidong Cai; Lingfeng Wen; David Dagan Feng; Sonia Pujol; Ron Kikinis; Michael J.

However, they are lengthy in duration and can be unreliable at times. To this end, we explored a modified connectome-based predictive modeling approach to estimating individualized scores from multiple cognitive domains using structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) features. Multi-shell HARDI and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, and scores from 10 cognitive measures were acquired from 91 older adults with mild cognitive impairment. SC and FC matrices were derived from these scans and, in various combinations, entered into models along with demographic covariates to predict cognitive scores. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. Predictive accuracy was assessed via the correlation between predicted and observed scores (rpredicted-observed). Across all cognitive measures, significant rpredicted-observed (0.402 to 0.654) were observed from the best-predicting models. Six of these models consisted of multimodal features. For three cognitive measures, their best-predicting models’ rpredicted-observed were similar to that of a model that included only demographic covariates— suggesting that SC and/or FC features did not contribute significantly on top of demographics. Cross-prediction models revealed that the best-predicting models were similarly accurate in predicting scores of related cognitive measures— suggesting their limited specificity in predicting cognitive scores. Generally, multimodal connectomes together with demographics, can be exploited as sensitive markers, though with limited specificity, to predict cognitive performance across a spectrum in multiple cognitive domains. In certain situations, it may not be worthwhile to acquire neuroimaging data, considering that demographics alone can be similarly accurate in predicting cognitive scores.",0.48514438,0.5172646,0.5388765,0.5656452,0.475832,0.43027753,0.41863576,0.4101966,0.4757927,0.44091937,0.46996367,0.42115182,0.46564096,0.47929198,The individualized prediction of cognitive test scores in mild cognitive impairment using structural and functional connectivity features,12/1/2020,,Junhong Yu; Iris Rawtaer; Johnson Fam; Lei Feng; Ee Heok Kua; Rathi Mahendran,NeuroImage,15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85090035007&origin=inward,,,,,2020,"@article{,

We assessed grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) structure in a group of 66 adults aged between 23 and 81. Multimodal imaging measures included voxel-based morphometry (VBM)-style analysis of GM and WM volume and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of WM microstructure.

In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics.

Current artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on individual information or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can solve the problem of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, but still face the challenges of interpretability and clinical feasibility. In this study, we propose an interpretable multimodal deep reinforcement learning model for inferring pathological features and the diagnosis of AD. Approach. First, for better clinical feasibility, the compressed-sensing MRI image is reconstructed using an interpretable deep reinforcement learning model. Then, the reconstructed MRI is input into the full convolution neural network to generate a pixel-level disease probability risk map (DPM) of the whole brain for AD. The DPM of important brain regions and individual information are then input into the attention-based fully deep neural network to obtain the diagnosis results and analyze the biomarkers. We used 1349 multi-center samples to construct and test the model. Main results. Finally, the model obtained 99.6% ± 0.2%, 97.9% ± 0.2%, and 96.1% ± 0.3% area under curve in ADNI, AIBL and NACC, respectively. The model also provides an effective analysis of multimodal pathology, predicts the imaging biomarkers in MRI and the weight of each individual item of information. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning model was designed, which can not only accurately diagnose AD, but analyze potential biomarkers. Significance. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning model was designed. The model builds a bridge between clinical practice and AI diagnosis and provides a viewpoint for the interpretability of AI technology.",0.5588238,0.5802036,0.58281004,0.64292294,0.5410182,0.621088,0.51884234,0.49882242,0.5147164,0.5321997,0.58238524,0.54250544,0.54707414,0.55480444,A whole-process interpretable and multi-modal deep reinforcement learning for diagnosis and analysis of Alzheimer's disease,12/1/2021,,Quan Zhang; Qian Du; Guohua Liu,Journal of Neural Engineering,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122549039&origin=inward,,,,,2021,"@article{,

This study aims to design and implement the first deep learning (DL) model to classify subjects in the prodromic states of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Approach. EEG recordings of 17 healthy controls (HCs), 56 subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and 45 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects were acquired at resting state. After preprocessing, we selected sections corresponding to eyes-closed condition. Five different datasets were created by extracting delta, theta, alpha, beta and delta-to-theta frequency bands using bandpass filters. To classify SCD vs MCI and HC vs SCD vs MCI, we propose a framework based on the transformer architecture, which uses multi-head attention to focus on the most relevant parts of the input signals. We trained and validated the model on each dataset with a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach, splitting the signals into 10 s epochs. Subjects were assigned to the same class as the majority of their epochs. Classification performances of the transformer were assessed for both epochs and subjects and compared with other DL models. Main results. Results showed that the delta dataset allowed our model to achieve the best performances for the discrimination of SCD and MCI, reaching an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.807, while the highest results for the HC vs SCD vs MCI classification were obtained on alpha and theta with a micro-AUC higher than 0.74. Significance. We demonstrated that DL approaches can support the adoption of non-invasive and economic techniques as EEG to stratify patients in the clinical population at risk for AD. This result was achieved since the attention mechanism was able to learn temporal dependencies of the signal, focusing on the most discriminative patterns, achieving state-of-the-art results by using a deep model of reduced complexity.

Thus, here we aimed to identify serum metabolic biomarkers for the diagnosis of COPD. Methods: In this study, we investigated serum metabolic features between COPD patients (n = 54) and normal individuals (n = 74) using a 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach and developed an integrated method of least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) and serum metabolic biomarkers to assist COPD diagnosis. Results: We observed a hypometabolic state in serum of COPD patients, as indicated by decreases in N-acetyl-glycoprotein (NAG), lipoprotein (LOP, mainly LDL/VLDL), polyunsaturated fatty acid (pUFA), glucose, alanine, leucine, histidine, valine, and lactate. Using an integrated method of multivariable and univariate analyses, NAG and LOP were identified as two important metabolites for distinguishing between COPD patients and controls. Subsequently, we developed a LS-SVM classifier using these two markers and found that LS-SVM classifiers with linear and polynomial kernels performed better than the classifier with RBF kernel. Linear and polynomial LS-SVM classifiers can achieve the total accuracy rates of 80.77% and 84.62% and the AUC values of 0.87 and 0.90 for COPD diagnosis, respectively.

Nowadays, Random Forest (RF) algorithm has been successfully applied for reducing high dimensional and multi-source data in many scientific realms. Our aim was to explore the state of the art of the application of RF on single and multi-modal neuroimaging data for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted on this field of study. In particular, we constructed an advanced query using boolean operators as follows: (""random forest"" OR ""random forests"") AND neuroimaging AND (""alzheimer's disease"" OR alzheimer's OR alzheimer) AND (prediction OR classification). The query was then searched in four well-known scientific databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Results: Twelve articles-published between the 2007 and 2017-have been included in this systematic review after a quantitative and qualitative selection. The lesson learnt from these works suggest that when RF was applied on multi-modal data for prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) conversion from the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), it produces one of the best accuracies to date. Moreover, the RF has important advantages in terms of robustness to overfitting, ability to handle highly non-linear data, stability in the presence of outliers and opportunity for efficient parallel processing mainly when applied on multi-modality neuroimaging data, such as, MRI morphometric, diffusion tensor imaging, and PET images. Conclusions: We discussed the strengths of RF, considering also possible limitations and by encouraging further studies on the comparisons of this algorithm with other commonly used classification approaches, particularly in the early prediction of the progression from MCI to AD.",0.4612772,0.58402866,0.57046205,0.56311345,0.5071365,0.49332258,0.47193336,0.46523455,0.49603844,0.5067616,0.54243726,0.4891559,0.49609283,0.5364399,Random forest algorithm for the classification of neuroimaging data in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review,10/6/2017,,Alessia Sarica; Antonio Cerasa; Aldo Quattrone,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,362,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85031098588&origin=inward,,,,,2017,"@article{,

Methods and materials: The proposed method consists of five stages: (a) preprocessing of fMRI data, (b) modeling of the fMRI voxel time series using a generalized linear model, (c) feature extraction from the fMRI experiment, (d) feature selection, and (e) classification using the random forests algorithm. In the last stage we employ features that were extracted from the fMRI and other features such as demographics, behavioral and volumetric measures. The aim of the classification is twofold: first to diagnose AD and second to classify AD as very mild and mild. Results: The method is evaluated using data from 41 subjects. The stage of AD is established using the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center recruitment and assessment procedures. The method classifies a patient as healthy or demented with 84% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity, and the stages of AD with 81% and 87% accuracy for the three class and the four class problem, respectively. Conclusions: The method is advantageous since it is fully automated and for the first time the diagnosis and staging of the disease are addressed using fMRI. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",0.49680266,0.5533684,0.552013,0.53292364,0.5017069,0.46487913,0.4758535,0.47807518,0.5141582,0.50390553,0.5324225,0.48918796,0.50770134,0.580852,A supervised method to assist the diagnosis and monitor progression of Alzheimer's disease using data from an fMRI experiment,9/1/2011,,Evanthia E.

We enrolled 6,701 individuals, which were randomly divided into training data sets (6030 participants) and test data sets (671 participants). We evaluated each diagnostic model in the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which consists of CN subjects, subjects with aMCI, and subjects with AD with both CSF and MRI. Baseline CSF (t-tau, Aβ1-42, and p-tau181P) and MRI scans were obtained in 399 subjects (109 CN, 192 aMCI, 98 AD). Structural Abnormality Index (STAND) scores, which reflect the degree of AD-like anatomic features on MRI, were computed for each subject. RESULTS: We found no significant correlation between CSF biomarkers and cognitive scores in any of the 3 clinical groups individually. Conversely, STAND scores correlated with both Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes and Mini-Mental State Examination in aMCI and AD (p ≤ 0.01). While STAND and all CSF biomarkers were predictors of clinical group membership (CN, aMCI, or AD) univariately (p < 0.001), STAND was more predictive than CSF both univariately and in combined models. CONCLUSIONS: CSF and MRI biomarkers independently contribute to intergroup diagnostic discrimination and the combination of CSF and MRI provides better prediction than either source of data alone. However, MRI provides greater power to effect cross-sectional groupwise discrimination and better correlation with general cognition and functional status cross-sectionally. We therefore conclude that although MRI and CSF provide complementary information, MRI reflects clinically defined disease stage better than the CSF biomarkers tested. © 2009 AAN Enterprises, Inc.",0.43863517,0.4895658,0.5074914,0.5686746,0.44435647,0.38525057,0.38237005,0.3647701,0.46178666,0.43373296,0.42270976,0.4307994,0.44964707,0.47125635,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

METHODS: The authors recruited 22 patients with MCI, 22 patients with probable AD, and 20 healthy subjects (HS). T1 volumes from each subject were postprocessed according to an optimized VBM protocol. All patients were clinically followed up (mean [SD] time = 28.7 [5.7] months), and patients with MCI were reclassified into two groups (converters and nonconverters to AD). RESULTS: When comparing patients with AD to HS, widespread areas of reduced gray matter density were found predominantly in temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes and in the insula. Comparing MCI converters and nonconverters with HS, the converters showed more widespread areas of reduced gray matter density than nonconverters, with a pattern of abnormalities similar to that seen in patients with AD. Conversely, when comparing the same groups with patients with AD, MCI nonconverters showed a pattern of gray matter density similar to that of HS. Areas of decreased gray matter density were also found in MCI converters compared with nonconverters. CONCLUSIONS: Different patterns of gray matter density distribution in patients with mild cognitive impairment may be associated to different rates of conversion to Alzheimer disease.

Background: Libraries of sMR scans of clinically well characterized subjects can be harnessed for the purpose of diagnosing new incoming subjects. Methods: One hundred ninety patients with probable AD were age- and gender-matched with 190 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Three different classification models were implemented: Model I uses tissue densities obtained from sMR scans to give STructural Abnormality iNDex (STAND)-score; and Models II and III use tissue densities as well as covariates (demographics and Apolipoprotein E genotype) to give adjusted-STAND (aSTAND)-score. Data from 140 AD and 140 CN were used for training. The SVM parameter optimization and training were done by four-fold cross validation (CV). The remaining independent sample of 50 AD and 50 CN was used to obtain a minimally biased estimate of the generalization error of the algorithm. Results: The CV accuracy of Model II and Model III aSTAND-scores was 88.5% and 89.3%, respectively, and the developed models generalized well on the independent test data sets. Anatomic patterns best differentiating the groups were consistent with the known distribution of neurofibrillary AD pathology. Conclusions: This paper presents preliminary evidence that application of SVM-based classification of an individual sMR scan relative to a library of scans can provide useful information in individual subjects for diagnosis of AD. Including demographic and genetic information in the classification algorithm slightly improves diagnostic accuracy. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Baseline brain MRI was performed in 139 patients with MCI, broadly defined, and 63 healthy controls followed for an average of 5 years (range 1 to 9 years). RESULTS: Hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes were each largest in controls, intermediate in MCI nonconverters, and smallest in MCI converters to AD (37 of 139 patients converted to AD). In separate Cox proportional hazards models, covarying for intracranial volume, smaller hippocampal volume (risk ratio [RR] 3.62, 95% CI 1.93 to 6.80, p < 0.0001), and entorhinal cortex volume (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.79, p < 0.0001) each predicted time to conversion to AD. Similar results were obtained for hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volume in patients with MCI with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ≥ 27 out of 30 (21% converted to AD) and in the subset of patients with amnestic MCI (35% converted to AD). In the total patient sample, when both hippocampal and entorhinal volume were entered into an age-stratified Cox model with sex, MMSE, education, and intracranial volume, smaller hippocampal volume (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.29, p < 0.02) and entorhinal cortex volume (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.97, p < 0.0002) predicted time to conversion to AD. Similar results were obtained in a Cox model that also included Selective Reminding Test (SRT) delayed recall and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Symbol as predictors. Based on logistic regression models in the 3-year follow-up sample, for a fixed specificity of 80%, the sensitivities for MCI conversion to AD were as follows: age 43.3%, MMSE 43.3%, age + MMSE 63.7%, age + MMSE + SRT delayed recall + WAIS-R Digit Symbol 80.6% (79.6% correctly classified), hippocampus + entorhinal cortex 66.7%, age + MMSE + hippocampus + entorhinal cortex 76.7% (85% correctly classified), age + MMSE + SRT delayed recall + WAIS-R Digit Symbol + hippocampus + entorhinal cortex 83.3% (86.8% correctly classified). CONCLUSIONS: Smaller hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes each contribute to the prediction of conversion to Alzheimer disease. Age and cognitive variables also contribute to prediction, and the added value of hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes is small. Nonetheless, combining these MRI volumes with age and cognitive measures leads to high levels of predictive accuracy that may have potential clinical application. ©2007AAN Enterprises, Inc.",0.4353662,0.4995073,0.49047723,0.48910603,0.43814063,0.39651892,0.40401295,0.39413136,0.44839978,0.43428782,0.42959836,0.4074537,0.4539394,0.48158264,Hippocampal and entorhinal atrophy in mild cognitive impairment: Prediction of Alzheimer disease,3/1/2007,,D.

Methods: It was achieved by patch-based sparse representation (SR), using the training samples with a complete set of MRI, L-PET and S-PET modalities for dictionary construction. However, the number of training samples with complete modalities is often limited. In practice, many samples generally have incomplete modalities (i.e., with one or two missing modalities) that thus cannot be used in the prediction process. In light of this, we develop a semisupervised tripled dictionary learning (SSTDL) method for S-PET image prediction, which can utilize not only the samples with complete modalities (called complete samples) but also the samples with incomplete modalities (called incomplete samples), to take advantage of the large number of available training samples and thus further improve the prediction performance. Results: Validation was done on a real human brain dataset consisting of 18 subjects, and the results show that our method is superior to the SR and other baseline methods. Conclusion: This paper proposed a new S-PET prediction method, which can significantly improve the PET image quality with low-dose injection. Significance: The proposed method is favorable in clinical application since it can decrease the potential radiation risk for patients.",0.3556921,0.46104237,0.42303422,0.47155595,0.4127806,0.3329666,0.36285123,0.3487548,0.35968375,0.379534,0.3716839,0.36895737,0.34856236,0.4154585,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

Methods: Fifty-nine MCI patients (49% male, mean age 69 ± 8), follow-up 19 months, were included. Baseline CSF levels of Aβ1-42, tau and MTA-score were dichotomized. Results: Thirty-three (56%) of the MCI patients progressed to dementia, 30 of which had Alzheimer's disease. Lower CSF Aβ1-42 level, higher CSF-tau and higher MTA-scores at baseline were found in progressed patients. Cox proportional hazards models revealed that abnormal CSF Aβ1-42, CSF tau and MTA were significantly associated with dementia at follow-up (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 4.0 (1.3-12.1), 5.9 (1.6-21.7) and 2.1 (1.0-4.6)). A fourfold higher risk was found for patients with both abnormal CSF biomarkers and MTA compared to patients with either test abnormal. Ninety-four percent of patients with both abnormalities converted to dementia.

Background: The AAN previously published a practice parameter on dementia in 1994. New research and clinical developments warrant an update of some aspects of diagnosis. Methods: Studies published in English from 1985 through 1999 were identified that addressed four questions: 1) Are the current criteria for the diagnosis of dementia reliable? 2) Are the current diagnostic criteria able to establish a diagnosis for the prevalent dementias in the elderly? 3) Do laboratory tests improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of dementing illness? 4) What comorbidities should be evaluated in elderly patients undergoing an initial assessment for dementia? Recommendations: Based on evidence in the literature, the following recommendations are made. 1) The DSM-III-R definition of dementia is reliable and should be used (Guideline). 2) The National Institute of Neurologic, Communicative Disorders and Stroke-AD and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised (DSM-IIIR) diagnostic criteria for AD and clinical criteria for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have sufficient reliability and validity and should be used (Guideline). Diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia may be of use in clinical practice (Option) but have imperfect reliability and validity. 3) Structural neuroimaging with either a noncontrast CT or MR scan in the initial evaluation of patients with dementia is appropriate. Because of insufficient data on validity, no other imaging procedure is recommended (Guideline). There are currently no genetic markers recommended for routine diagnostic purposes (Guideline). The CSF 14-3-3 protein is useful for confirming or rejecting the diagnosis of CJD (Guideline). 4) Screening for depression, B12 deficiency, and hypothyroidism should be performed (Guideline). Screening for syphilis in patients with dementia is not justified unless clinical suspicion for neurosyphilis is present (Guideline). Conclusions: Diagnostic criteria for dementia have improved since the 1994 practice parameter. Further research is needed to improve clinical definitions of dementia and its subtypes, as well as to determine the utility of various instruments of neuroimaging, biomarkers, and genetic testing in increasing diagnostic accuracy.",0.364682,0.3679082,0.37019634,0.3778303,0.34373593,0.4276676,0.3733057,0.35785717,0.429097,0.3550156,0.41666016,0.34530163,0.3736225,0.35719714,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

Here we investigated whether the cortical signature of AD-related thinning is present in individuals with questionable AD dementia (QAD) and whether a greater degree of regional cortical thinning predicts mild AD dementia. METHODS: Participants included 49 older adults with mild impairment consistent with mild cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] = 0.5) at the time of structural MRI scanning. Cortical thickness was measured in nine regions of interest (ROIs) identified previously from a comparison of patients with mild AD and controls. RESULTS: Longitudinal clinical follow-up revealed that 20 participants converted to mild AD dementia (progressors) while 29 remained stable (nonprogressors) approximately 2.5 years after scanning. At baseline, QAD participants showed a milder degree of cortical thinning than typically seen in mild AD, and CDR Sum-of-Boxes correlated with thickness in temporal and parietal ROIs. Compared to nonprogressors, progressors showed temporal and parietal thinning. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the thickness of an aggregate measure of these regions predicted progression to mild AD with 83% sensitivity and 65% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Thinning in specific cortical areas known to be affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) is detectable in individuals with questionable AD dementia (QAD) and predicts conversion to mild AD dementia. This method could be useful for identifying individuals at relatively high risk for imminent progression from QAD to mild AD dementia, which may be of value in clinical trials. © 2009 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.",0.41675076,0.42419484,0.43443683,0.4072622,0.40709227,0.40650913,0.38970733,0.381203,0.4586433,0.41839856,0.41249505,0.3910593,0.44110957,0.41357693,The cortical signature of prodromal AD: Regional thinning predicts mild AD dementia,3/24/2009,,Akram Bakkour; John C.

In all leading countries, it is one of the primary reasons of death in senior citizens. Currently, it is diagnosed by calculating the MSME score and by the manual study of MRI Scan. Also, different machine learning methods are utilized for automatic diagnosis but existing has some limitations in terms of accuracy. So, main objective of this paper to include a preprocessing method before CNN model to increase the accuracy of classification. Materials and method: In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach for detection of Alzheimer's Disease from ADNI database of Alzheimer's disease patients, the dataset contains fMRI and PET images of Alzheimer's patients along with normal person's image. We have applied 3D to 2D conversion and resizing of images before applying VGG-16 architecture of Convolution neural network for feature extraction. Finally, for classification SVM, Linear Discriminate, K means clustering, and Decision tree classifiers are used. Results: The experimental result shows that the average accuracy of 99.95% is achieved for the classification of the fMRI dataset, while the average accuracy of 73.46% is achieved with the PET dataset. On comparing results on the basis of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and on some other parameters we found that these results are better than existing methods. Conclusions: this paper, suggested a unique way to increase the performance of CNN models by applying some preprocessing on image dataset before sending to CNN architecture for feature extraction.

It affects the livelihood of not just patients, but those who take care of them, including care givers, nurses, and close family members. Current progression monitoring techniques are based on MRI and PET scans which are inconvenient for patients to use. In addition, more intelligent and efficient methods are needed to predict what the current stage of the disease is and strategies on how to slow down its progress over time. Technology or Method: In this paper, machine learning was used with S-parameter data obtained from 6 antennas that were placed around the head to noninvasively capture changes in the brain in the presence of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Measurements were conducted for 9 different human models that varied in head sizes. The data was processed in several machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm's prediction and accuracy score were generated, and the results were compared to determine which machine learning algorithm could be used to efficiently classify different stages of Alzheimer's disease. Results: Results from the study showed that overall, the logistic regression model had the best accuracy of 98.97% and efficiency in differentiating between 4 different stages of Alzheimer's disease.

Background: Cross-sectional studies consistently reveal cerebral atrophy in elderly nondemented subjects compared with healthy young adults, and greater atrophy in patients with AD relative to elderly control subjects. However, rates of atrophy are estimated most accurately by performing serial measurements in the same individuals. Methods: MRI-based volumetric measurements of the hippocampi and temporal horns were performed in 24 cognitively normal subjects aged 70 to 89 years who were individually matched with respect to gender and age with 24 patients with AD. Each subject underwent an MRI protocol twice, separated by 12 months or more. Results: The mean annual rate of hippocampal volume loss among control subjects was -1.55 ± 1.38% and the temporal horns increased in volume by 6.15 ± 7.69% per year.

Methods: This retrospective study used MRI data from 24 early-onset AD and 33 early-onset FTD patients and 34 controls (CN). Classification was based on voxel-wise feature maps derived from structural MRI, ASL, and DTI. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained to classify AD versus CN (AD-CN), FTD-CN, AD-FTD, and AD-FTD-CN (multi-class). Classification performance was assessed by the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy. Using SVM significance maps, we analysed contributions of brain regions. Results: Combining ASL and DTI with structural MRI resulted in higher classification performance for differential diagnosis of AD and FTD (AUC = 84%; p = 0.05) than using structural MRI by itself (AUC = 72%). The performance of ASL and DTI themselves did not improve over structural MRI. The classifications were driven by different brain regions for ASL and DTI than for structural MRI, suggesting complementary information. Conclusions: ASL and DTI are promising additions to structural MRI for classification of early-onset AD, early-onset FTD, and controls, and may improve the computer-aided differential diagnosis on a single-subject level.

Quantitative and qualitative methods of assessing the medial temporal lobe were also compared. Methods: Patients with minor cognitive impairment older than 50 years (n=31) were selected from a memory clinic and were followed up for on average 1.9 years. The medial temporal lobe was assessed in three different ways: volumetry of the hippocampus, volumetry of the parahippocampal gyrus, and qualitative rating of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA). Outcome measures were Alzheimer type dementia or cognitive decline at follow up. Delayed recall was tested with a verbal learning test. Results: Ten patients had experienced cognitive decline at follow up, of whom seven had probable Alzheimer type dementia. All medial temporal lobe measurements were associated with cognitive decline at follow up (p trend analysis between 0.001 (hippocampus) and 0.05 (parahippocampal gyrus)). Only the hippocampal volume and MTA score were associated with Alzheimer type dementia at follow up (p trend analysis respectively 0.003 and 0.01). All medial temporal lobe measurements increased the predictive accuracy of age and the delayed recall score for cognitive decline (p increase in predictive accuracy varied between <0.001 (hippocampus) and 0.02 (parahippocampal gyrus and MTA score)) and the hippocampal volume and the MTA score increased the predictive accuracy of age and the delayed recall score for Alzheimer type dementia (p= 0.02).

In this work, a method to perform early diagnosis of AD is proposed, combining different feature reduction approaches on both brain MRI studies and expression values of blood plasma proteins. Each selected set of features is used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM), then the set of SVM is combined by weighted sum rule. Moreover, a novel approach for considering the feature vector as an image is proposed, different texture descriptors are extracted from the image and used to train a SVM. The superior performance of the proposed system is obtained without any ad hoc parameter optimization (i.e., the same ensemble of classifiers and the same parameter settings are used in all datasets). The MATLAB code for the ensemble of classifiers will be publicly available3",0.5077971,0.60117596,0.59612036,0.5355526,0.5234408,0.52684903,0.50115913,0.51172227,0.54991007,0.57884413,0.5458038,0.5053414,0.53466314,0.5921921,Combining multiple approaches for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,12/1/2016,,Loris Nanni; Christian Salvatore; Antonio Cerasa; Isabella Castiglioni,Pattern Recognition Letters,27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84994613598&origin=inward,,,,259-266,2016,"@article{,

Artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning (ML), has established as one of more powerful approach to extract reliable predictors and to automatically classify different AD phenotypes. It is time to accelerate the translation of this knowledge in clinical practice, mainly by using low-cost features originating from the neuropsychological assessment. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the contribution of ML and neuropsychological measures for the automated classification of MCI patients and the prediction of their conversion to AD. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of patients’ classifications was obtained by means of a quantitative bivariate random-effect meta-analytic approach.

However, it's believed that the geometrical relation among target vectors in the training set may provide useful information, and it would be natural to expect that the predicted vectors have similar geometric relations as the target vectors. To overcome these limitations, we formulate this as a graph-matching feature selection problem between a predicted graph and a target graph. In the predicted graph a node is represented by predicted vector that may describe regional gray matter volume or cortical thickness features, and in the target graph a node is represented by target vector that include class label and clinical scores. In particular, we devise new regularization terms in sparse representation to impose high-order graph matching between the target vectors and the predicted ones. Finally, the selected regional gray matter volume and cortical thickness features are fused in kernel space for classification.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides a unique tool for non-invasive investigation of these brain diseases. However, it is extremely difficult for neurologists to identify complex disease patterns from large amounts of three-dimensional images. In contrast, machine learning excels at automatic pattern recognition from large amounts of data. In particular, deep learning has achieved impressive results in image classification. Unfortunately, its application to medical image classification remains difficult. We consider two reasons for this difficulty: First, volumetric medical image data is considerably scarcer than natural images. Second, the complexity of 3D medical images is much higher compared to common 2D images. To address the problem of small data set size, we assemble the largest dataset ever used for training a deep 3D convolutional neural network to classify brain images as healthy (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimers disease (AD). We use more than 20.000 images from subjects of these three classes, which is almost 9x the size of the previously largest data set. The problem of high dimensionality is addressed by using a deep 3D convolutional neural network, which is state-of-the-art in large-scale image classification.

However, these algorithms require a large training dataset to perform well on a particular task. To this effect, we have applied a deep convolution neural network classifier that incorporates transfer learning and data augmentation techniques to improve the classification.

The limited resolution of PET leads to ""tissue-fraction"" effects, reflecting underlying tissue heterogeneity, and ""spillover"" effects between regions. Addressing the former problem in general requires supplementary data, for example, coregistered high-resolution magnetic resonance images, whereas the latter effect can be corrected for with PET data alone if the point-spread function of the tomograph has been characterized. Analysis of otherwise homogeneous region-of-interest data ideally requires a combination of tissue classification and correction for the point-spread function. The formulation of appropriate algorithms for partial volume correction (PVC) is dependent on both the distribution of the signal and the distribution of the underlying noise. A mathematical framework has therefore been developed to accommodate both of these factors and to facilitate the development of new PVC algorithms based on the description of the problem. Several methodologies and algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the literature in order to address these problems. These methods do not, however, explicitly consider the noise model while differing in their underlying assumptions. The general theory for estimation of regional concentrations, associated error estimation, and inhomogeneity tests are presented in a weighted least squares framework. The analysis has been validated using both simulated and real PET data sets. The relations between the current algorithms and those published previously are formulated and compared.

Three-view patches (TVPs) from these regions were fed to the CNN for training. MRIs were classified with the SoftMax-normalized scores of individual model predictions on TVPs. The significance of each region of interest (ROI) for staging the AD spectrum was evaluated and reported. The results of the ensemble classifier are compared with state-of-the-art methods using the same evaluation metrics.

By considering the nature of pathological changes, a large number of features related to both local brain regions and interbrain regions can be extracted for classification. However, it is challenging to design a single global classifier to integrate all these features for effective classification, due to the issue of small sample size. To this end, we propose a hierarchical ensemble classification method to combine multilevel classifiers by gradually integrating a large number of features from both local brain regions and interbrain regions. Thus, the large-scale classification problem can be divided into a set of small-scale and easier-to-solve problems in a bottom-up and local-to-global fashion, for more accurate classification. To demonstrate its performance, we use the spatially normalized grey matter (GM) of each MR brain image as imaging features. Specifically, we first partition the whole brain image into a number of local brain regions and, for each brain region, we build two low-level classifiers to transform local imaging features and the inter-region correlations into high-level features. Then, we generate multiple high-level classifiers, with each evaluating the high-level features from the respective brain regions. Finally, we combine the outputs of all high-level classifiers for making a final classification. Our method has been evaluated using the baseline MR images of 652 subjects (including 198 AD patients, 225 MCI patients, and 229 normal controls (NC)) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental results show that our classification method can achieve the accuracies of 92.0% and 85.3% for classifications of AD versus NC and MCI versus NC, respectively, demonstrating very promising classification performance compared to the state-of-the-art classification methods. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.5538813,0.6528208,0.61791056,0.5301822,0.5614872,0.46276,0.49601302,0.4958658,0.56680226,0.6079826,0.5514749,0.51146376,0.57002854,0.6400199,Hierarchical fusion of features and classifier decisions for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,1/1/2014,,Manhua Liu; Daoqiang Zhang; Dinggang Shen,Human Brain Mapping,101,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84896396327&origin=inward,,,,1305-1319,2014,"@article{,

However, brain atrophy is variable across patients and is non-specific for AD in general. Thus, automatic methods for AD classification require a large number of structural data due to complex and variable patterns of brain atrophy. In this paper, we propose an incremental method for AD classification using cortical thickness data. We represent the cortical thickness data of a subject in terms of their spatial frequency components, employing the manifold harmonic transform. The basis functions for this transform are obtained from the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which are dependent only on the geometry of a cortical surface but not on the cortical thickness defined on it. This facilitates individual subject classification based on incremental learning. In general, methods based on region-wise features poorly reflect the detailed spatial variation of cortical thickness, and those based on vertex-wise features are sensitive to noise. Adopting a vertex-wise cortical thickness representation, our method can still achieve robustness to noise by filtering out high frequency components of the cortical thickness data while reflecting their spatial variation. This compromise leads to high accuracy in AD classification. We utilized MR volumes provided by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to validate the performance of the method. Our method discriminated AD patients from Healthy Control (HC) subjects with 82% sensitivity and 93% specificity. It also discriminated Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients, who converted to AD within 18. months, from non-converted MCI subjects with 63% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Moreover, it showed that the entorhinal cortex was the most discriminative region for classification, which is consistent with previous pathological findings. In comparison with other classification methods, our method demonstrated high classification performance in both categories, which supports the discriminative power of our method in both AD diagnosis and AD prediction. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0.529209,0.54997003,0.5544567,0.465198,0.51827455,0.4467043,0.5127106,0.51102006,0.5525167,0.53677994,0.5335275,0.5023339,0.536432,0.60218316,Individual subject classification for Alzheimer's disease based on incremental learning using a spatial frequency representation of cortical thickness data,2/1/2012,,Youngsang Cho; Joon Kyung Seong; Yong Jeong; Sung Yong Shin,NeuroImage,169,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84855418467&origin=inward,,,,2217-2230,2012,"@article{,

Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

High prevalence will possibly be reduced if early interventions could be applied to the stage of early MCI (eMCI). In network-based classification, brain functional networks are often constructed, relying on the entire time series. It can lead to the neglect of the complex and dynamic interaction relationships among brain regions. As a result, the features derived from this type of functional network may fail to serve as an effective disease biomarker. To address this problem, we proposed a multi-scale feature combination framework for the eMCI classification. In this framework, global static features, time-varying features, and more refined features could be able to flexibly extract from static functional networks, dynamic functional networks, and high-order functional networks, respectively. Then, they are utilized to train and test the classification model in the form of feature combination.

Animal studies suggest reduction in the activity of this signaling system with age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of healthy aging on brain incorporation of 11C-AA, before and after partial-volume correction (PVC). Methods: Absolute measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) were obtained in 8 young and 7 old healthy subjects (mean age ± SD, 27 ± 5 y and 65 ± 9 y) with bolus injection of 15O-water. About 15 min later, dynamic 60-min 3-dimensional scans were acquired after the injection of 11C-AA. Radioactivity frames of 11C-AA were corrected for head motion and registered to magnetic resonance (MR) images. A 3-segment (3S) and a 2-segment (2S) PVC was applied pixel-by-pixel to the activity frames. For the 3S method, the white matter value was estimated using a new automatic method by extrapolating the activity values of pixels with white matter membership > 0.99. Parametric images of the brain incorporation rate of 11C-AA (K*) and cerebral blood volume (Vb), as well as CBF, were generated and regional gray matter values were obtained. Results: Among cortical areas, there were no significant differences (uncorrected P < 0.05) in K* or Vb absolute values between young and old subjects before or after PVC. A significant reduction of CBF was detected in the frontal cortex of the elderly group. After normalization to the global gray average, K*, Vb, and CBF values revealed significant reductions in the frontal lobe of old subjects; none of these differences were significant after PVC. Conclusion: These results confirm previous PET findings that brain function at rest is minimally affected by healthy aging. Proper PVC methodology is of critical importance in accurate quantitative assessment of PET physiologic measures.",0.32861093,0.32618886,0.29971233,0.3914601,0.31512755,0.28812143,0.34880158,0.32732892,0.37200683,0.31051758,0.328705,0.3356986,0.30688068,0.34432256,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

These dynamic sequences show a rapidly advancing wave of cortical atrophy sweeping from limbic and temporal cortices into higher-order association and ultimately primary sensorimotor areas, in a pattern that correlates with cognitive decline. A complementary technique, TBM, reveals the 3D profile of atrophic rates, at each point in the brain. A third technique, hippocampal surface modeling, plots the profile of shape alterations across the hippocampal surface. The three techniques provide moderate to highly automated analyses of images, have been validated on hundreds of scans, and are sensitive to clinically relevant changes in individual patients and groups undergoing different drug treatments. We compare time-lapse maps of AD, MCI, and other dementias, correlate these changes with cognition, and relate them to similar time-lapse maps of childhood development, schizophrenia, and HIV-associated brain degeneration.

To obtain high-quality PET images requires a standard-dose radionuclide (tracer) injection into the human body, which inevitably increases risk of radiation exposure. One possible solution to this problem is to predict the standard-dose PET image from its low-dose counterpart and its corresponding multimodal magnetic resonance (MR) images. Inspired by the success of patch-based sparse representation (SR) in super-resolution image reconstruction, we propose a mapping-based SR (m-SR) framework for standard-dose PET image prediction. Compared with the conventional patch-based SR, our method uses a mapping strategy to ensure that the sparse coefficients, estimated from the multimodal MR images and low-dose PET image, can be applied directly to the prediction of standard-dose PET image. As the mapping between multimodal MR images (or low-dose PET image) and standard-dose PET images can be particularly complex, one step of mapping is often insufficient. To this end, an incremental refinement framework is therefore proposed. Specifically, the predicted standard-dose PET image is further mapped to the target standard-dose PET image, and then the SR is performed again to predict a new standard-dose PET image. This procedure can be repeated for prediction refinement of the iterations. Also, a patch selection based dictionary construction method is further used to speed up the prediction process. The proposed method is validated on a human brain dataset. The experimental results show that our method can outperform benchmark methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures.",0.35072428,0.44518277,0.42826432,0.47973034,0.38845327,0.323892,0.33057797,0.31834605,0.36125457,0.37586832,0.3568125,0.37646458,0.33223766,0.40234143,Predicting standard-dose PET image from low-dose PET and multimodal MR images using mapping-based sparse representation,1/6/2016,,Yan Wang; Pei Zhang; Le An; Guangkai Ma; Jiayin Kang; Feng Shi; Xi Wu; Jiliu Zhou; David S.

Significant associations between the classification output and clinical characteristics of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a middle stage of dementia) groups provide solid neurobiological support for the 3DAN model.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential of revealing early signs of neurodegeneration in the human brain and may thus aid in predicting and diagnosing AD. Surface-based cortical thickness measurements from T1-weighted MRI have demonstrated high sensitivity to cortical gray matter changes. In this study we investigated the possibility for using patterns of cortical thickness measurements for predicting AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used a novel technique for identifying cortical regions potentially discriminative for separating individuals with MCI who progress to probable AD, from individuals with MCI who do not progress to probable AD. Specific patterns of atrophy were identified at four time periods before diagnosis of probable AD and features were selected as regions of interest within these patterns. The selected regions were used for cortical thickness measurements and applied in a classifier for testing the ability to predict AD at the four stages. In the validation, the test subjects were excluded from the feature selection to obtain unbiased results. The accuracy of the prediction improved as the time to conversion from MCI to AD decreased, from 70% at 3. years before the clinical criteria for AD was met, to 76% at 6. months before AD. By inclusion of test subjects in the feature selection process, the prediction accuracies were artificially inflated to a range of 73% to 81%. Two important results emerge from this study. First, prediction accuracies of conversion from MCI to AD can be improved by learning the atrophy patterns that are specific to the different stages of disease progression. This has the potential to guide the further development of imaging biomarkers in AD. Second, the results show that one needs to be careful when designing training, testing and validation schemes to ensure that datasets used to build the predictive models are not used in testing and validation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0.5243102,0.5573253,0.5791095,0.5245761,0.51936764,0.469434,0.48865062,0.4785739,0.5528397,0.5385886,0.5396987,0.49738625,0.5391378,0.5511825,Prediction of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with mild cognitive impairment from the ADNI cohort using patterns of cortical thinning,1/15/2013,,Simon F.

In the present study, we predicted amyloid positivity with structural MRI using a radiomics approach. From MR images (including T1, T2 FLAIR, and DTI sequences) of 440 MCI patients, we extracted radiomics features composed of histogram and texture features. These features were used alone or in combination with baseline non-imaging predictors such as age, sex, and ApoE genotype to predict amyloid positivity. We used a regularized regression method for feature selection and prediction. The performance of the baseline non-imaging model was at a fair level (AUC = 0.71). Among single MR-sequence models, T1 and T2 FLAIR radiomics models also showed fair performances (AUC for test = 0.71–0.74, AUC for validation = 0.68–0.70) in predicting amyloid positivity. When T1 and T2 FLAIR radiomics features were combined, the AUC for test was 0.75 and AUC for validation was 0.72 (p vs. baseline model < 0.001). The model performed best when baseline features were combined with a T1 and T2 FLAIR radiomics model (AUC for test = 0.79, AUC for validation = 0.76), which was significantly better than those of the baseline model (p < 0.001) and the T1 + T2 FLAIR radiomics model (p < 0.001).

In this study, we propose a dual-model radiomic analysis with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to investigate promising risk factors associated with MCI conversion to AD. T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data, from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database, were collected from 131 patients with MCI who converted to AD within 3 years and 132 patients with MCI without conversion within 3 years. These subjects were randomly partition into 70% training dataset and 30% test dataset with multiple times. We fused MRI and PET images by wavelet method. In a subset of subjects, a group comparison was performed using a two-sample t-test to determine regions of interest (ROIs) associated with MCI conversion. 172 radiomic features from ROIs for each individual were established using a published radiomics tool. Finally, L1-penalized Cox model was constructed and Harrell's C index (C-index) was used to evaluate prediction accuracy of the model. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed method, we used a same analysis framework to evaluate MRI and PET data separately. We constructed prognostic Cox models with: clinical data, MRI images, PET images, fused MRI/PET images, and clinical variables and fused MRI/PET images in combination. The experimental results showed that captured ROIs significantly associated with conversion to AD, such as gray matter atrophy in the bilateral hippocampus and hypometabolism in the temporoparietal cortex. Imaging model (MRI/PET/fused) provided significant enhancement in prediction of conversion compared to clinical models, especially the fused-modality Cox model. Moreover, the combination of fused-modality imaging and clinical variables resulted in the greatest accuracy of prediction. The average C-index for the clinical/MRI/PET/fused/combined model in the test dataset was 0.69, 0.73, 0.73 and 0.75, and 0.78, respectively. These results suggested that a combination of radiomic analysis and Cox model analyses could be used successfully in survival analysis and may be powerful tools for personalized precision medicine patients with potential to undergo conversion from MCI to AD.",0.47501364,0.58743495,0.60639864,0.63893485,0.51369435,0.4847286,0.4663415,0.45817327,0.5084302,0.5285684,0.5120218,0.47564676,0.51804537,0.54369545,Dual-model radiomic biomarkers predict development of mild cognitive impairment progression to Alzheimer's disease,1/1/2019,,Hucheng Zhou; Jiehui Jiang; Jiaying Lu; Min Wang; Huiwei Zhang; Chuantao Zuo,Frontiers in Neuroscience,34,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065469848&origin=inward,,,,,2019,"@article{,

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose a decision supporting model based on deep learning and machine learning to predict the conversion probability from MCI into AD within one year. We analyzed 165 samples with MRI scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, in which all MCI patients were converted into AD in different time span for conversion. In this model, we first extracted image features based on convolutional neural network (CNN) method, and then we used support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify these features.

A large number of potential predictors have been proposed, with most investigations tending to examine one or a set of related predictors. In this study, we simultaneously examined multiple features from different modalities of data, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and neuropsychological and functional measures (NMs), to explore an optimal set of predictors of conversion from MCI to AD in an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. After FreeSurfer-derived MRI feature extraction, CSF and NM feature collection, feature selection was employed to choose optimal subsets of features from each modality. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were then trained on normal control (NC) and AD participants. Testing was conducted on MCIc (MCI individuals who have converted to AD within 24 months) and MCInc (MCI individuals who have not converted to AD within 24 months) groups. Classification results demonstrated that NMs outperformed CSF and MRI features. The combination of selected NM, MRI and CSF features attained an accuracy of 67.13%, a sensitivity of 96.43%, a specificity of 48.28%, and an AUC (area under curve) of 0.796. Analysis of the predictive values of MCIc who converted at different follow-up evaluations showed that the predictive values were significantly different between individuals who converted within 12 months and after 12 months.

This has been interpreted as compensatory reallocation of cognitive resources, but direct evidence for a facilitating effect on performance has been lacking. To address this we measured neural activity during semantic and episodic memory tasks in mildly demented AD patients and healthy elderly controls. Controls recruited a left hemisphere network of regions, including prefrontal and temporal cortices in both the semantic and episodic tasks. Patients engaged a unique network involving bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior cortices. Critically, activity in this network of regions was correlated with better performance on both the semantic and episodic tasks in the patients.

However, feature selection, which is one of the most important steps in classification, is typically performed separately for each modality, which ignores the potentially strong inter-modality relationship within each subject. Recent emergence of multi-task learning approach makes the joint feature selection from different modalities possible. However, joint feature selection may unfortunately overlook different yet complementary information conveyed by different modalities. We propose a novel multi-task feature selection method to preserve the complementary inter-modality information. Specifically, we treat feature selection from each modality as a separate task and further impose a constraint for preserving the inter-modality relationship, besides separately enforcing the sparseness of the selected features from each modality. After feature selection, a multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) is further used to integrate the selected features from each modality for classification. Our method is evaluated using the baseline PET and MRI images of subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our method achieves a good performance, with an accuracy of 94.37% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9724 for AD identification, and also an accuracy of 78.80% and an AUC of 0.8284 for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identification. Moreover, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 67.83% and an AUC of 0.6957 for separating between MCI converters and MCI non-converters (to AD).

Furthermore, recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have also shown that low-frequency (<0.08 Hz) fluctuations (LFF) of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signals were abnormal in several brain areas of AD patients. However, few studies have investigated disturbed LFF connectivity in AD patients. By using resting-state fMRI, this study sought to investigate the abnormal functional connectivities throughout the entire brain of early AD patients, and analyze the global distribution of these abnormalities. For this purpose, the authors divided the whole brain into 116 regions and identified abnormal connectivities by comparing the correlation coefficients of each pair. Compared with healthy controls, AD patients had decreased positive correlations between the prefrontal and parietal lobes, but increased positive correlations within the prefrontal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe. The AD patients also had decreased negative correlations (closer to zero) between two intrinsically anti-correlated networks that had previously been found in the resting brain. By using resting-state fMRI, our results supported previous studies that have reported an anterior-posterior disconnection phenomenon and increased within-lobe functional connectivity in AD patients. In addition, the results also suggest that AD may disturb the correlation/anti-correlation effect in the two intrinsically anti-correlated networks. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",0.39063373,0.41716668,0.40022075,0.4194767,0.38707706,0.33680037,0.36291653,0.34670123,0.41168025,0.38049936,0.40205756,0.3830132,0.4120762,0.39349675,Altered functional connectivity in early Alzheimer's disease: A resting-state fMRI study,10/1/2007,,Kun Wang; Meng Liang; Liang Wang; Lixia Tian; Xinqing Zhang; Kuncheng Li; Tianzi Jiang,Human Brain Mapping,604,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=35148890661&origin=inward,,,,967-978,2007,"@article{,

The purpose of this paper was to enhance the spectral resolution of 1H MRSI data from human calf muscle using the SPREAD (spectral resolution amelioration by deconvolution) technique and to assess the influence of improved spectral resolution on the accuracy of spectral fitting and on in vivo measurement of IMCLs. We acquired MRI and 1H MRSI data from calf muscles of three healthy volunteers. We reconstructed spectral lineshapes of the 1H MRSI data based on field maps and used the lineshapes to deconvolve the measured MRS spectra, thereby eliminating the line broadening caused by field inhomogeneities and improving the spectral resolution of the 1H MRSI data. We employed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with 200 noise realizations to measure the variations of spectral fitting parameters and used an F-test to evaluate the significance of the differences of the variations between the spectra before SPREAD and after SPREAD. We also used Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) to assess the improvements of spectral fitting after SPREAD. The use of SPREAD enhanced the separation between EMCL and IMCL peaks in 1H MRSI spectra from human calf muscle. MC simulations and F-tests showed that the use of SPREAD significantly reduced the standard deviations of the estimated IMCL peak areas (p < 10-8), and the CRLBs were strongly reduced (by ~37%).",0.2555142,0.3073662,0.30008885,0.32081085,0.23329592,0.21080253,0.22630255,0.20585498,0.30897784,0.23883604,0.27724192,0.2670383,0.23902473,0.27154094,Improving the spectral resolution and spectral fitting of 1H MRSI data from human calf muscle by the SPREAD technique,11/1/2014,,Zhengchao Dong; Yudong Zhang; Feng Liu; Yunsuo Duan; Alayar Kangarlu; Bradley S.

Recent attempts have been made to redefine the diagnostic criteria of AD to include markers of neurodegeneration – measurable by FDG-PET – and markers of amyloid accumulation – measurable by amyloid-PET. Materials and methods A systematic review of the literature was performed to examine the current diagnostic use of amyloid and FDG PET. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Database were searched for relevant papers Results and discussion This search resulted in twenty-nine papers on amyloid imaging, twenty-three papers on FDG-PET and eight papers which utilized both techniques. Both modalities are considered in turn with regards to their diagnostic accuracy, their role in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and prognostication, their use in the differential diagnosis of AD and their clinical application. As evidenced from the current literature, both amyloid and FDG-PET meet criteria for suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. They both indicate pathophysiological processes, albeit at different stages of the Alzheimer's process, and are distinct from normal patterns of aging. Conclusion Both techniques have been shown to detect AD with high sensitivity and specificity compared to other neurodegenerative processes and cognitively normal age-matched individuals. However, future studies with standardised, uniform thresholds and a lengthier longitudinal follow-up need to be conducted to allow us to make surer conclusions about the future role of PET in clinical practice. In addition, comparison with post-mortem diagnosis, rather than clinical diagnosis with its acknowledged flaws, would result in more powerful statistical outcomes – which is becoming increasingly important given that several disease-modifying AD drugs are now in phase 3 trials.",0.43454415,0.4682728,0.47545102,0.5981649,0.44371185,0.48241624,0.4261604,0.40241697,0.4692591,0.43534097,0.46500084,0.44340906,0.44853517,0.43819422,The diagnostic value of FDG and amyloid PET in Alzheimer's disease—A systematic review,9/1/2017,,Louise Rice; Sotirios Bisdas,European Journal of Radiology,101,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85025699670&origin=inward,,,,16-24,2017,"@article{,

A clinically relevant issue is the selection of high-risk subjects who need active surveillance among equivocal cases. We validated the clinical feasibility of DL compared with visual rating or quantitative measurement for assessing the diagnosis and prognosis of subjects with equivocal amyloid scans. Methods: 18F-florbetaben scans of 430 cases (85 NC, 233 mild cognitive impairment, and 112 AD) were assessed through visual rating-based, quantification-based, and DL-based methods. DL was trained using 280 two-dimensional PET images (80%) and tested by randomly assigning the remaining (70 cases, 20%) cases and a clinical validation set of 54 equivocal cases. In the equivocal cases, we assessed the agreement among the visual rating, quantification, and DL and compared the clinical outcome according to each modality-based amyloid status. Results: The visual reading was positive in 175 cases, equivocal in 54 cases, and negative in 201 cases. The composite SUVR cutoff value was 1.32 (AUC 0.99). The subject-level performance of DL using the test set was 100%. Among the 54 equivocal cases, 37 cases were classified as positive (Eq(deep+)) by DL, 40 cases were classified by a second-round visual assessment, and 40 cases were classified by quantification. The DL- and quantification-based classifications showed good agreement (83%, κ = 0.59). The composite SUVRs differed between Eq(deep+) (1.47 [0.13]) and Eq(deep−) (1.29 [0.10]; P < 0.001). DL, but not the visual rating, showed a significant difference in the Mini-Mental Status Examination score change during the follow-up between Eq(deep+) (− 4.21 [0.57]) and Eq(deep−) (− 1.74 [0.76]; P = 0.023) (mean duration, 1.76 years). Conclusions: In visually equivocal scans, DL was more related to quantification than to visual assessment, and the negative cases selected by DL showed no decline in cognitive outcome. DL is useful for clinical diagnosis and prognosis assessment in subjects with visually equivocal amyloid scans.",0.5039973,0.538799,0.53090906,0.5715422,0.56095624,0.5558139,0.5143509,0.5076361,0.5111164,0.5405652,0.57992685,0.5315962,0.5659769,0.57460916,The clinical feasibility of deep learning-based classification of amyloid PET images in visually equivocal cases,2/1/2020,,Hye Joo Son; Jungsu S.

The basic idea of the presented work in this paper is to determine the level of dementia accurately such that the patients can receive medication before their condition worsens. The results produced by existing models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are not satisfactory enough for large datasets. Methods: This paper suggests a solution based on Amalgamation of deep learning models. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) Brain, has been used for experimental purposes. The first phase focuses on implementing the primary models i.e., CNN, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The second phase implements ensemble technique to combine these three models using a weighted average approach. An approach called Bagging is applied in all the three models to decrease the variance and the three Bagged models are combined using the ensemble method. Results: The results show that the ensemble of CNN, RNN, and LSTM achieved an accuracy of 89.75% whereas the ensemble after Bagging the primary models achieved an accuracy of 92.22%. Conclusion: On comparison, the ensemble of Bagged models achieved better results than ensemble of primary models.

In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely used on analysis of neuroimage for quantitative evaluation and computer-aided diagnosis of AD or prediction on the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. In this study, we aimed to develop a new deep learning method to detect or predict AD in an efficient way. Materials and methods: We proposed a densely connected convolution neural network with connection-wise attention mechanism to learn the multi-level features of brain MR images for AD classification. We used the densely connected neural network to extract multi-scale features from pre-processed images, and connection-wise attention mechanism was applied to combine connections among features from different layers to hierarchically transform the MR images into more compact high-level features. Furthermore, we extended the convolution operation to 3D to capture the spatial information of MRI. The features extracted from each 3D convolution layer were integrated with features from all preceding layers with different attention, and were finally used for classification. Our method was evaluated on the baseline MRI of 968 subjects from ADNI database to discriminate (1) AD versus healthy subjects, (2) MCI converters versus healthy subjects, and (3) MCI converters versus non-converters. Results: The proposed method achieved 97.35% accuracy for distinguishing AD patients from healthy control, 87.82% for MCI converters against healthy control, and 78.79% for MCI converters against non-converters. Compared with some neural networks and methods reported in recent studies, the classification performance of our proposed algorithm was among the top ranks and improved in discriminating MCI subjects who were in high risks of conversion to AD.

This review focuses on challenges points to be clarified about how to develop AI applications as clinical decision support systems in the real-world context. Methods: A narrative review has been performed including a critical assessment of articles published between 1989 and 2021 that guided challenging sections. Results: We first illustrate the architectural characteristics of machine learning (ML)/radiomics and deep learning (DL) approaches. For ML/radiomics, the phases of feature selection and of training, validation, and testing are described. DL models are presented as multi-layered artificial/convolutional neural networks, allowing us to directly process images. The data curation section includes technical steps such as image labelling, image annotation (with segmentation as a crucial step in radiomics), data harmonization (enabling compensation for differences in imaging protocols that typically generate noise in non-AI imaging studies) and federated learning. Thereafter, we dedicate specific sections to: sample size calculation, considering multiple testing in AI approaches; procedures for data augmentation to work with limited and unbalanced datasets; and the interpretability of AI models (the so-called black box issue). Pros and cons for choosing ML versus DL to implement AI applications to medical imaging are finally presented in a synoptic way.

Approach: Our study implements and compares several deep models and configurations, including two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). To use a 2D CNN on 3D MRI volumes, each MRI scan is split into 2D slices, neglecting the connection among 2D image slices in an MRI volume. Instead, a CNN model could be followed by an RNN in a way that the model of 2D CNN + RNN can understand the connection among sequences of 2D image slices for an MRI. The issue is that the feature extraction step in the 2D CNN is independent of classification in the RNN. To tackle this, 3D CNNs can be employed instead of 2D CNNs to make voxel-based decisions. Our study's main contribution is to introduce transfer learning from a dataset of 2D images to 3D CNNs. Results: The results on our MRI dataset indicate that sequence-based decisions improve the accuracy of slice-based decisions by 2% in classifying AD patients from healthy subjects. Also the 3D voxel-based method with transfer learning outperforms the other methods with 96.88% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 94.12% specificity.

However, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use. We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD subjects and AD-related brain regions. Method: First, we used maximum inter-class variance (ICV) to select key slices from 3D volumetric data. Second, we generated an eigenbrain set for each subject. Third, the most important eigenbrain (MIE) was obtained by Welch's t-test (WTT). Finally, kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization, were used to make an accurate prediction of AD subjects. Coefficients of MIE with values higher than 0.98 quantile were highlighted to obtain the discriminant regions that distinguish AD from NC. Results: The experiments showed that the proposed method can predict AD subjects with a competitive performance with existing methods, especially the accuracy of the polynomial kernel (92.36 ± 0.94) was better than the linear kernel of 91.47 ± 1.02 and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of 86.71 ± 1.93.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, genotype distribution and risk factors associated with anal HPV infection among men attending an STI clinic in Puerto Rico. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 205 men 18 years and older. A comprehensive survey was administered that included a demographic and a behavioral assessment. Separate logistic regression models were performed to determine factors associated with any, high-risk (HR), and multiple anal HPV infection. Results: The mean age of the study sample was 38.0±13.5 years. The most common HR types were 58, 51 and 31. Overall, HR anal HPV infection was found in 53.5% of the participants. Multiple HPV types in the anal canal were found in 47.6% of the sample. A third (29.8%) of participants reported being men who had sex with men (MSM). MSM had a significantly higher prevalence of any, HR and multiple HPV infection (p-value<0.05). Separate multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that being MSM was associated with any (OR = 4.5; [95%CI: 1.9-10.7]), HR (OR = 3.4; [95%CI: 1.1-10.3) and multiple anal HPV infection (OR = 3.6; [95%CI: 1.5-9.1). HIV was marginally associated with multiple anal HPV infection in multivariate analysis (OR = 3.3; 95%CI = 1.0-11.0). Conclusions: Anal HPV is common among sexually active men attending this STI clinic, with higher likelihood of anal HPV infection among MSM.

Methods: Thirty patients with very mild AD (age 67.0±5.8 years; MMSE score 25.5±1.2, range 24-28), 32 patients with mild AD (age 67.0±4.5 years, MMSE score 22.1±0.8, range 21-23) and 60 age- and sex-matched normal volunteers underwent both FDG-PET and three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo MRI. Statistical parametric mapping was used to conduct voxel by voxel analysis and Z score mapping. First, the region of interest (ROI) maps of significant reductions in glucose metabolism and grey matter density in the mild AD patients were defined. Secondly, analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for Z scores in the ROI maps discriminating very mild AD patients and normal controls was performed. Results: In mild AD patients, FDG-PET indicated significant reductions in glucose metabolism in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri and the right parietotemporal area, while VBM analysis showed a significant decrease in grey matter volume density in the bilateral amygdala/hippocampus complex, compared with the normal control group. ROC analysis showed that in very mild AD patients the accuracy of FDG-PET diagnosis was 89% and that of VBM-MRI diagnosis was 83%. The accuracy of the combination of FDG-PET and VBM-MRI diagnosis was 94%. Conclusion: In very mild AD, both FDG-PET and VBM-MRI had high accuracy for diagnosis, but FDG-PET showed slightly higher accuracy than VBM-MRI. Combination of the two techniques will yield a higher diagnostic accuracy in very mild AD by making full use of functional and morphological images. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",0.42760944,0.48837122,0.47828472,0.5990129,0.42867878,0.37232128,0.41344318,0.39615896,0.4711841,0.45046103,0.450445,0.4325973,0.4454717,0.5194951,Comparison of the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET and VBM-MRI in very mild Alzheimer's disease,7/1/2006,,Takashi Kawachi; Kazunari Ishii; Setsu Sakamoto; Masahiro Sasaki; Tetsuya Mori; Fumio Yamashita; Hiroshi Matsuda; Etsuro Mori,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,94,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33745565046&origin=inward,,,,801-809,2006,"@article{,

Methods: The SVM model processed metabolic data from anatomical volumes of interest also considering interhemispheric asymmetries. It was trained on a homogeneous dataset from a memory clinic center and tested on an independent multicentric dataset drawn from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Subjects were included in the study and classified based on a diagnosis confirmed after an adequate follow-up time. Results: The accuracy of the discrimination between patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD), in either prodromal or dementia stage, and normal aging subjects was 95.8%, after cross-validation, in the training set. The accuracy of the same model in the testing set was 86.5%. The role of the two datasets was then reversed, and the accuracy was 89.8% in the multicentric training set and 88.0% in the monocentric testing set. The classification rate was also evaluated in different subgroups, including non-converter mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, subjects with MCI reverted to normal conditions and subjects with non-confirmed memory concern. The percent of pattern detections increased from 77% in early prodromal AD to 91% in AD dementia, while it was about 10% for healthy controls and non-AD patients. Conclusions: The present findings show a good level of reproducibility and generalizability of a model for detecting the hypometabolic pattern in AD and confirm the accuracy of FDG-PET in Alzheimer disease.",0.45613608,0.52300715,0.5442047,0.56553555,0.5222968,0.45927513,0.50668955,0.48698103,0.51435924,0.4674333,0.4987296,0.44922632,0.46684906,0.55099297,Accuracy and generalization capability of an automatic method for the detection of typical brain hypometabolism in prodromal Alzheimer disease,2/1/2019,,Fabrizio De Carli; Flavio Nobili; Marco Pagani; Matteo Bauckneht; Federico Massa; Matteo Grazzini; Cathrine Jonsson; Enrico Peira; Silvia Morbelli; Dario Arnaldi,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055986240&origin=inward,,,,334-347,2019,"@article{,

Materials and methods: Retrospective 18F-FDG PET scans for AD, MCI-AD, and CN were collected from Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (556 patients from 2005 to 2020), and CN and DLB cases were from European DLB Consortium (201 patients from 2005 to 2018). The introduced 3D convolutional neural network was trained using 90% of the data and externally tested using 10% as well as comparison to human readers on the same independent test set. The model’s performance was analyzed with sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The regional metabolic changes driving classification were visualized using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and network attention. Results: The proposed model achieved area under the ROC curve of 96.2% (95% confidence interval: 90.6–100) on predicting the final diagnosis of DLB in the independent test set, 96.4% (92.7–100) in AD, 71.4% (51.6–91.2) in MCI-AD, and 94.7% (90–99.5) in CN, which in ROC space outperformed human readers performance.

2419,https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jmi.7.5.056001,3.42E-05,5,0,"Purpose: Through the last three decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided immense quantities of information about the dynamics of the brain, functional brain mapping, and resting-state brain networks. Despite providing such rich functional information, fMRI is still not a commonly used clinical technique due to inaccuracy involved in analysis of extremely noisy data. However, ongoing developments in deep learning techniques suggest potential improvements and better performance in many different domains. Our main purpose is to utilize the potentials of deep learning techniques for fMRI data for clinical use. Approach: We present one such synergy of fMRI and deep learning, where we apply a simplified yet accurate method using a modified 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) to resting-state fMRI data for feature extraction and classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The CNN is designed in such a way that it uses the fMRI data with much less preprocessing, preserving both spatial and temporal information. Results: Once trained, the network is successfully able to classify between fMRI data from healthy controls and AD subjects, including subjects in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. We have also extracted spatiotemporal features useful for classification. Conclusion: This CNN can detect and differentiate between the earlier and later stages of MCI and AD and hence, it may have potential clinical applications in both early detection and better diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.",0.52745545,0.54488087,0.5422918,0.57350826,0.54480684,0.5241301,0.50019085,0.49462855,0.50378597,0.54575163,0.59660125,0.55809015,0.5965636,0.5596223,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the local institutional review board and was compliant with HIPAA regulations. In formed consent was obtained. rCBF was measured in 38 control subjects, 29 MCI patients, and 37 AD patients who were participating in a longitudinal epidemiologic study. Multisection CASL MR imaging with alternating single and double adiabatic inversion pulses and ramp-sampled echo-planar imaging were performed to acquire 19 contiguous axial sections. Voxel-level rCBF was compared among groups by using an analysis of variance design; clusters of voxels with significant group differences were identified. Multiple regression models controlled for age, sex, and presence of hypertension and related the mean rCBF in those clusters to the presence of MCI and AD.Results: MCI and AD patients had decreased rCBF in the posterior cingulate gyrus (P = .01) with extension to the medial precuneus compared with that in control subjects. MCI patients had increased rCBF in the left hippocampus (P < .001), right amygdala (P = .007), and rostral head of the right caudate nucleus and ventral putamen and globus pallidus (P = .003) compared with that in control subjects. AD patients had decreased rCBF relative to that in control subjects and MCI patients in the left inferior parietal (P = .005), left lateral frontal (P < .001), left superior temporal (P = .001), and left orbitofrontal (P = .003) cortices. AD patients had increased rCBF in the right anterior cingulate gyrus ( P = .02) compared with that in control subjects. Conclusion: The transition from normal cognition to AD is associated with dynamic pathologic processes in the brain, and this is reflected by both decreases and increases in rCBF. In creases in rCBF suggest a cellular and vascular compensatory process associated with incipient AD. © RSNA, 2009.",0.38926926,0.4062778,0.4021613,0.44465077,0.41229555,0.38253877,0.39497745,0.37985858,0.44973782,0.40264705,0.40713152,0.4150106,0.41525808,0.43528488,Mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer disease: Patterns of altered cerebral blood flow at MR imaging,3/1/2009,,Weiying Dai; Oscar L.

Materials and Methods: The local institutional review board approved the study. Eighty-four patients with AD, 51 patients with bvFTD, and 94 control subjects were divided into independent training (n = 115) and prediction (n = 114) sets with identical diagnosis and imager type distributions. Training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier used diagnostic status and GM density maps and produced voxelwise discrimination maps. Discriminant function analysis was used to estimate suitability of the extracted weights for single-subject classification in the prediction set. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated for image-based classifiers and neuropsychological z scores. Results: Training accuracy of the SVM was 85% for patients with AD versus control subjects, 72% for patients with bvFTD versus control subjects, and 79% for patients with AD versus patients with bvFTD (P ≤ .029). Single-subject diagnosis in the prediction set when using the discrimination maps yielded accuracies of 88% for patients with AD versus control subjects, 85% for patients with bvFTD versus control subjects, and 82% for patients with AD versus patients with bvFTD, with a good to excellent AUC (range, 0.81-0.95; P ≤ .001). Machine learning-based categorization of AD versus bvFTD based on GM density maps outperforms classification based on neuropsychological test results. Conclusion: The SVM can be used in single-subject discrimination and can help the clinician arrive at a diagnosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three subject groups (nine cognitively healthy elderly control subjects, 10 patients with probable AD, and five subjects with MCI) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for measurement of functional synchrony in the hippocampus. Functional synchrony was defined and quantified as the mean of the cross-correlation coefficients of spontaneous low frequency (COSLOF) components between possible pairs of voxel time courses in a brain region, or the COSLOF index. The two-tailed Student t test was used to determine differences in the COSLOF index between the control group, the probable AD group, and the MCI group. An operating characteristic curve was calculated to graphically depict the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity of the COSLOF index. RESULTS: Functional synchrony quantified with the COSLOF index was obtained in AD, MCI, and control subjects. COSLOF index values were significantly lower in AD patients than in control subjects (t = 4.32, P < .0012). For MCI subjects, COSLOF index values were significantly higher than those of AD patients (t = -2.4052, P < .047) but significantly lower than those of control subjects (t = 2.257, P < .043). The exponential-class curve significantly fits the relationship between the COSLOF index and the Mini-Mental Status Examination score (X2 = 20.4), indicating the rapid decrease in cognitive capacity below a threshold of the COSLOF index. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the COSLOF index could be used as a noninvasive quantitative marker for the preclinical stage of AD. © RSNA, 2002.",0.3428042,0.41431877,0.3971184,0.43808487,0.38796043,0.3456858,0.36567858,0.35341758,0.42762724,0.35291055,0.39064667,0.37213323,0.38090184,0.40981847,Alzheimer disease: Evaluation of a functional MR imaging index as a marker,10/1/2002,,Shi Jiang Li; Zhu Li; Gaohong Wu; Mei Jie Zhang; Malgorzata Franczak; Piero G.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Twenty subjects with AD (13 men, seven women; mean age, 72.9 years), 18 with MCI (nine men, nine women; mean age, 73.3 years), and 23 CN subjects (10 men, 13 women; mean age, 72.9 years) underwent arterial spin-labeling and volumetric T1-weighted structural MR imaging. Perfusion images were coregistered to structural images, corrected for partial volume effects (PVEs) with information from the structural image to determine tissue content of perfusion voxels, and normalized to a study-specific template. Analyses of perfusion differences between groups, with and without corrections for PVEs, were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis with a one-tailed fixed-effects analysis of covariance model adjusted for age. In addition, tests were performed with and without accounting for global perfusion. RESULTS: The AD group showed significant regional hypoperfusion, compared with the CN group, in the right inferior parietal cortex extending into the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (P < .001), bilateral superior and middle frontal gyri (P < .001), and left inferior parietal lobe (P = .007). When PVEs from underlying cortical gray matter atrophy were accounted for, the AD group still showed hypoperfusion in the right inferior parietal lobe extending into the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (P < .001) and left (P = .003) and right (P = .012) middle frontal gyri. With a more liberal voxel-level threshold of P < .01, the MCI group showed significant regional hypoperfusion relative to the CN group in the inferior right parietal lobe (P = .046), similar to the region of greatest significance in the AD group. CONCLUSION: Arterial spin-labeling MR imaging showed regional hypoperfusion with AD, in brain regions similar to those seen in FDG PET and HMPAO SPECT studies of similar populations; this hypoperfusion persists after accounting for underlying cortical gray matter atrophy. © RSNA, 2005.",0.38499814,0.40832704,0.39411518,0.46411583,0.412989,0.35950327,0.39955756,0.3774256,0.44625616,0.38767353,0.4204694,0.40940756,0.39558437,0.41631687,Pattern of cerebral hypoperfusion in Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment measured with arterial spin-labeling MR imaging: Initial experience,3/1/2005,,Nathan A.

Materials and Methods: The regional ethics committee approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study included 25 patients with AD (11 men, 14 women; mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 73 years ± 6; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, 24.4 ± 2.7), 24 patients with amnestic MCI (10 men, 14 women; mean age ± SD, 74 years ± 8; MMSE score, 27.2 ± 1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13 men, 12 women; mean age ± SD, 64 years ± 8). For each participant, the hippocampi were automatically segmented on three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images with high spatial resolution. Segmentation was performed by using recently developed software that allows fast segmentation with minimal user input. Group differences in hippocampal volume were assessed by using Student t tests. To obtain robust estimates of P values, the correct classification rate, sensitivity, and specificity, bootstrap methods were used. Results: Significant hippocampal volume reductions were detected in all groups of patients (-32% in AD patients vs controls, P < .001; -19% in MCI patients vs controls, P < .001; and -15% in AD patients vs MCI patients, P < .01). Individual classification on the basis of hippocampal volume resulted in 84% correct classification (sensitivity, 84%; specificity, 84%) between AD patients and controls and 73% correct classification (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 70%) between MCI patients and controls. Conclusion: This automated method can serve as an alternative to manual tracing and may thus prove useful in assisting with the diagnosis of AD. © RSNA, 2008.",0.4469846,0.47944862,0.46719655,0.47384927,0.45439094,0.42602286,0.43766767,0.42776242,0.47940952,0.42954633,0.4671308,0.4390254,0.45424885,0.5654993,"Discrimination between Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal aging by using automated segmentation of the hippocampus",7/1/2008,,Olivier Colliot; Gaël Chételat; Marie Chupin; Béatrice Desgranges; Benoît Magnin; Habib Benali; Bruno Dubois; Line Garnero; Francis Eustache; Stéphane Lehéricy,Radiology,228,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=47249114750&origin=inward,,,,194-201,2008,"@article{,

Materials and Methods: Forty data sets from 39 patients (mean age 6 standard deviation [SD], 67 years 6 8), including 16 male patients and 23 female patients (mean age, 66 years 6 6 and 68 years 6 9, respectively), who underwent simultaneous amyloid (fluorine 18 [18F]–florbetaben) PET/MRI examinations were acquired from March 2016 through October 2017 and retrospectively analyzed. One hundredth of the raw list-mode PET data were randomly chosen to simulate a low-dose (1%) acquisition. Convolutional neural networks were implemented with low-dose PET and multiple MR images (PET-plus-MR model) or with low-dose PET alone (PET-only) as inputs to predict full-dose PET images. Quality of the synthesized images was evaluated while Bland-Altman plots assessed the agreement of regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) between image types. Two readers scored image quality on a five-point scale (5 = excellent) and determined amyloid status (positive or negative). Statistical analyses were carried out to assess the difference of image quality metrics and reader agreement and to determine confidence intervals (CIs) for reading results. Results: The synthesized images (especially from the PET-plus-MR model) showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose image. All PET-plus-MR images scored 3 or higher, with proportions of images rated greater than 3 similar to those for the full-dose images (210% difference [eight of 80 readings], 95% CI: 215%, 25%). Accuracy for amyloid status was high (71 of 80 readings [89%]) and similar to intrareader reproducibility of full-dose images (73 of 80 [91%]). The PET-plus-MR model also had the smallest mean and variance for SUVR difference to full-dose images. Conclusion: Simultaneously acquired MRI and ultra–low-dose PET data can be used to synthesize full-dose–like amyloid PET images.",0.44500506,0.52350736,0.48909545,0.6195562,0.50072646,0.45907456,0.47071594,0.45809686,0.45108882,0.47431242,0.5043461,0.48535082,0.4806903,0.49526238,Ultra–Low-Dose 18F-Florbetaben Amyloid PET Imaging Using Deep Learning with Multi-Contrast MRI Inputs,3/1/2019,,Kevin T.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with institutional review board approval and was in compliance with HIPAA regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to acquire the voxelwise time series in 55 subjects with clinically diagnosed AD (n = 20), aMCI (n =15), and normal cognitive function (n = 20). The brains were divided into 116 regions of interest (ROIs). The Pearson product moment correlation coefficients of pairwise ROIs were used to classify these subjects. Error estimation of the classifications was performed with the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between changes in network connectivity strengths and behavioral scores. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) yielded 87% classification power, 85% sensitivity, and 80% specificity between the AD group and the non-AD group (subjects with aMCI and CN subjects) in the first-step classification. For differentiation between subjects with aMCI and CN subjects, AUC was 95%; sensitivity, 93%; and specificity, 90%. The decreased network indexes were significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score in all tested subjects. Similarly, changes in network indexes significantly correlated with Rey Auditory Verbal Leaning Test delayed recall scores in subjects with aMCI and CN subjects. Conclusion: LSN analysis revealed that interconnectivity patterns of brain regions can be used to classify subjects with AD, those with aMCI, and CN subjects. In addition, the altered connectivity networks were significantly correlated with the results of cognitive tests. © RSNA, 2011.",0.48529482,0.5057431,0.5297287,0.5038114,0.5098997,0.4357928,0.45031583,0.43467823,0.5111558,0.49002755,0.49014226,0.46675345,0.529726,0.5499313,"Classification of Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal cognitive status with large-scale network analysis based on resting-state functional MR imaging",4/1/2011,,Gang Chen; B.

In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside.3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0.25009215,0.3232222,0.2786103,0.34249982,0.27467817,0.31587812,0.2067034,0.19944686,0.25189206,0.29349005,0.2740672,0.31022778,0.25669053,0.34902683,3D Slicer as an image computing platform for the Quantitative Imaging Network,11/1/2012,,Andriy Fedorov; Reinhard Beichel; Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer; Julien Finet; Jean Christophe Fillion-Robin; Sonia Pujol; Christian Bauer; Dominique Jennings; Fiona Fennessy; Milan Sonka; John Buatti; Stephen Aylward; James V.

In this paper, improvements to this method are described, and also an extension of SIENA to a new method for cross-sectional (single time point) analysis. The methods are fully automated, robust, and accurate: 0.15% brain volume change error (longitudinal): 0.5-1% brain volume accuracy for single-time point (cross-sectional).

Despite these benefits, RF is not used actively to predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with brain MRIs. Recent studies have reported RF’s effectiveness in predicting AD, but the test sample sizes were too small to draw any solid conclusions. Thus, it is timely to compare RF with other learning model methods, including deep learning, particularly with large amounts of data. In this study, we tested RF and various machine learning models with regional volumes from 2250 brain MRIs: 687 normal controls (NC), 1094 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 469 AD that ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database) provided. Three types of features sets (63, 29, and 22 features) were selected, and classification accuracies were computed with RF, Support vector machine (SVM), Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional neural network (CNN). As a result, RF, MLP, and CNN showed high performances of 90.2%, 89.6%, and 90.5% with 63 features. Interestingly, when 22 features were used, RF showed the smallest decrease in accuracy, −3.8%, and the standard deviation did not change significantly, while MLP and CNN yielded decreases in accuracy of −6.8% and −4.5% with changes in the standard deviation from 3.3% to 4.0% for MLP and 2.1% to 7.0% for CNN, indicating that RF predicts AD more reliably with fewer features. In addition, we investigated the importance of the features that RF provides, and identified the hippocampus, amygdala, and inferior lateral ventricle as the major contributors in classifying NC, MCI, and AD. On average, AD showed smaller hippocampus and amygdala volumes and a larger volume of inferior lateral ventricle than those of MCI and NC.",0.51652145,0.6347988,0.60312945,0.55916995,0.5403563,0.51285857,0.52051264,0.51851416,0.52859485,0.5656275,0.5694799,0.5329667,0.5510047,0.6241145,Diagnostic classification and biomarker identification of alzheimer’s disease with random forest algorithm,4/1/2021,,Minseok Song; Hyeyoom Jung; Seungyong Lee; Donghyeon Kim; Minkyu Ahn,Brain Sciences,41,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104532636&origin=inward,,,,,2021,"@article{,

However, very few models have been developed to integrate both clinical and imaging data, despite that in routine practice clinicians rely on EMR to provide context in medical imaging interpretation. In this study, we developed and compared different multimodal fusion model architectures that are capable of utilizing both pixel data from volumetric Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography scans and clinical patient data from the EMR to automatically classify Pulmonary Embolism (PE) cases. The best performing multimodality model is a late fusion model that achieves an AUROC of 0.947 [95% CI: 0.946–0.948] on the entire held-out test set, outperforming imaging-only and EMR-only single modality models.",0.40283352,0.52147365,0.499423,0.56810886,0.45819527,0.41988736,0.41468883,0.41321093,0.4084681,0.47701523,0.48096204,0.4402198,0.46808088,0.49833158,Multimodal fusion with deep neural networks for leveraging CT imaging and electronic health record: a case-study in pulmonary embolism detection,12/1/2020,,Shih Cheng Huang; Anuj Pareek; Roham Zamanian; Imon Banerjee; Matthew P.

However, collecting large datasets for medical imaging is still a challenge due to privacy concerns and labeling costs. Data augmentation makes it possible to greatly expand the amount and variety of data available for training without actually collecting new samples. Data augmentation techniques range from simple yet surprisingly effective transformations such as cropping, padding, and flipping, to complex generative models. Depending on the nature of the input and the visual task, different data augmentation strategies are likely to perform differently. For this reason, it is conceivable that medical imaging requires specific augmentation strategies that generate plausible data samples and enable effective regularization of deep neural networks. Data augmentation can also be used to augment specific classes that are underrepresented in the training set, e.g., to generate artificial lesions. The goal of this systematic literature review is to investigate which data augmentation strategies are used in the medical domain and how they affect the performance of clinical tasks such as classification, segmentation, and lesion detection. To this end, a comprehensive analysis of more than 300 articles published in recent years (2018–2022) was conducted.

At the same time, machine-learning-based computational tools for early diagnosis and decision support systems are adopted to uncover hidden patterns in data for phenotype stratification and to identify pathological scenarios. In this landscape, ensemble learning approaches, conceived to simulate human behavior in making decisions, are suitable methods in healthcare prediction tasks, generally improving classification performances. In this work, we propose a novel technique for the automatic discrimination between healthy controls and AD patients, using DTI measures as predicting features and a softvoting ensemble approach for the classification. We show that this approach, efficiently combining single classifiers trained on specific groups of features, is able to improve classification performances with respect to the comprehensive approach of the concatenation of global features (with an increase of up to 9% on average) and the use of individual groups of features (with a notable enhancement in sensitivity of up to 11%).

The purpose of this study was to examine regional LFBF coherence patterns in early AD and the impact of regional brain atrophy on the functional results. Both structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI scans were collected from 14 AD subjects and 14 age-matched normal controls. We found significant regional coherence decreases in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu) in the AD patients when compared with the normal controls. Moreover, the decrease in the PCC/PCu coherence was correlated with the disease progression measured by the Mini-Mental State Exam scores. The changes in LFBF in the PCC/PCu may be related to the resting hypometabolism in this region commonly detected in previous positron emission tomography studies of early AD. When the regional PCC/PCu atrophy was controlled, these results still remained significant but with a decrease in the statistical power, suggesting that the LFBF results are at least partly explained by the regional atrophy. In addition, we also found increased LFBF coherence in the bilateral cuneus, right lingual gyrus and left fusiform gyrus in the AD patients. These regions are consistent with previous findings of AD-related increased activation during cognitive tasks explained in terms of a compensatory-recruitment hypothesis. Finally, our study indicated that regional brain atrophy could be an important consideration in functional imaging studies of neurodegenerative diseases. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Of various machine-learning techniques, sparse regression models have proved their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data but with a small number of training samples, especially in medical problems. In the meantime, deep learning methods have been making great successes by outperforming the state-of-the-art performances in various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the two conceptually different methods of sparse regression and deep learning for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, we first train multiple sparse regression models, each of which is trained with different values of a regularization control parameter. Thus, our multiple sparse regression models potentially select different feature subsets from the original feature set; thereby they have different powers to predict the response values, i.e., clinical label and clinical scores in our work. By regarding the response values from our sparse regression models as target-level representations, we then build a deep convolutional neural network for clinical decision making, which thus we call ‘Deep Ensemble Sparse Regression Network.’ To our best knowledge, this is the first work that combines sparse regression models with deep neural network. In our experiments with the ADNI cohort, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving the highest diagnostic accuracies in three classification tasks.

Most studies combining language processing and machine learning for the prediction of MCI focus on a single language task; here, we consider a cascaded approach to combine data from multiple language tasks. A cohort of 26 MCI participants and 29 healthy controls completed three language tasks: picture description, reading silently, and reading aloud. Information from each task is captured through different modes (audio, text, eye-tracking, and comprehension questions). Features are extracted from each mode, and used to train a series of cascaded classifiers which output predictions at the level of features, modes, tasks, and finally at the overall session level. The best classification result is achieved through combining the data at the task level (AUC = 0.88, accuracy = 0.83). This outperforms a classifier trained on neuropsychological test scores (AUC = 0.75, accuracy = 0.65) as well as the “early fusion” approach to multimodal classification (AUC = 0.79, accuracy = 0.70). By combining the predictions from the multimodal language classifier and the neuropsychological classifier, this result can be further improved to AUC = 0.90 and accuracy = 0.84. In a correlation analysis, language classifier predictions are found to be moderately correlated (ρ = 0.42) with participant scores on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). The cascaded approach for multimodal classification improves both system performance and interpretability. This modular architecture can be easily generalized to incorporate different types of classifiers as well as other heterogeneous sources of data (imaging, metabolic, etc.).",0.44143042,0.4972533,0.5663197,0.56768906,0.47371027,0.4429807,0.4292069,0.41846028,0.48024264,0.4670628,0.4827763,0.4493535,0.47940534,0.49713743,Predicting MCI status from multimodal language data using cascaded classifiers,1/1/2019,,Kathleen C.

Although BOLD fMRI is a high temporal resolution fMRI approach to assess alterations in brain networks, it cannot pinpoint to a single correlation of neuronal activity since BOLD signals are composite. In contrast, arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a lower temporal resolution fMRI technique for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) that can provide quantitative, direct brain network physiology measurements. This paper proposes a novel sparse regression algorithm for inference of the integrated hyper-connectivity networks from BOLD fMRI and ASL fMRI. Specifically, a least absolution shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, which is constrained by the functional connectivity derived from ASL fMRI, is employed to estimate hyper-connectivity for characterizing BOLD-fMRI-based functional interaction among multiple regions. An ASL-derived functional connectivity is constructed by using an Ultra-GroupLASSO-UOLS algorithm, where the combination of ultra-least squares (ULS) criterion with a group LASSO (GroupLASSO) algorithm is applied to detect the topology of ASL-based functional connectivity networks, and then an ultra-orthogonal least squares (UOLS) algorithm is used to estimate the connectivity strength. By combining the complementary characterization conveyed by rs-fMRI and ASL fMRI, our multimodal hyper-networks demonstrated much better discriminative characteristics than either the conventional pairwise connectivity networks or the unimodal hyper-connectivity networks. Experimental results on publicly available ADNI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing single modality based sparse functional connectivity inference methods.",0.47512782,0.5312393,0.53920335,0.56962115,0.44377303,0.39621207,0.4454423,0.44340068,0.44096315,0.47573826,0.48213708,0.45804995,0.47873035,0.49027202,Multimodal hyper-connectivity of functional networks using functionally-weighted LASSO for MCI classification,2/1/2019,,Yang Li; Jingyu Liu; Xinqiang Gao; Biao Jie; Minjeong Kim; Pew Thian Yap; Chong Yaw Wee; Dinggang Shen,Medical Image Analysis,65,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056984235&origin=inward,,,,80-96,2019,"@article{,

However, end-to-end learning that is capable of maximizing the impact of deep learning has yet to receive much attention due to the endemic challenge of neuroimaging caused by the scarcity of data. Thus, this study presents an approach meant to encourage the end-to-end learning of a volumetric convolutional neural network (CNN) model for four binary classification tasks (AD vs. normal control (NC), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) vs. NC, stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and visualizes its outcomes in terms of the decision of the CNNs without any human intervention. In the proposed approach, we use convolutional autoencoder (CAE)-based unsupervised learning for the AD vs. NC classification task, and supervised transfer learning is applied to solve the pMCI vs. sMCI classification task. To detect the most important biomarkers related to AD and pMCI, a gradient-based visualization method that approximates the spatial influence of the CNN model’s decision was applied. To validate the contributions of this study, we conducted experiments on the ADNI database, and the results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved the accuracies of 86.60% and 73.95% for the AD and pMCI classification tasks respectively, outperforming other network models.

Most studies, however, are biased for one specific scale, namely the scale given by the spatial resolution (i.e. dimension) of the data. In the present study, we propose to use the dual-tree complex wavelet transform to extract information on different spatial scales from structural MRI data and show its relevance for disease classification. Based on the magnitude representation of the complex wavelet coefficients calculated from the MR images, we identified a new class of features taking scale, directionality and potentially local information into account simultaneously. By using a linear support vector machine, these features were shown to discriminate significantly between spatially normalized MR images of 41 patients suffering from multiple sclerosis and 26 healthy controls. Interestingly, the decoding accuracies varied strongly among the different scales and it turned out that scales containing low frequency information were partly superior to scales containing high frequency information. Usually, this type of information is neglected since most decoding studies use only the original scale of the data. In conclusion, our proposed method has not only a high potential to assist in the diagnostic process of multiple sclerosis, but can be applied to other diseases or general decoding problems in structural or functional MRI. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0.46065104,0.480735,0.5105765,0.47346216,0.4716485,0.39127684,0.42060855,0.4167707,0.46692327,0.5000465,0.4584816,0.4643654,0.4735635,0.52490205,Multi-scale classification of disease using structural MRI and wavelet transform,8/1/2012,,Kerstin Hackmack; Friedemann Paul; Martin Weygandt; Carsten Allefeld; John Dylan Haynes,NeuroImage,63,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84861633811&origin=inward,,,,48-58,2012,"@article{,

Unfortunately, the unfavorable high-dimensional nature of neuroimaging data, but a limited small number of samples available, makes it challenging to build a robust computer-aided diagnosis system. Machine learning techniques have been considered as a useful tool in this respect and, among various methods, sparse regression has shown its validity in the literature. However, to our best knowledge, the existing sparse regression methods mostly try to select features based on the optimal regression coefficients in one step. We argue that since the training feature vectors are composed of both informative and uninformative or less informative features, the resulting optimal regression coefficients are inevidently affected by the uninformative or less informative features. To this end, we first propose a novel deep architecture to recursively discard uninformative features by performing sparse multi-task learning in a hierarchical fashion. We further hypothesize that the optimal regression coefficients reflect the relative importance of features in representing the target response variables. In this regard, we use the optimal regression coefficients learned in one hierarchy as feature weighting factors in the following hierarchy, and formulate a weighted sparse multi-task learning method. Lastly, we also take into account the distributional characteristics of samples per class and use clustering-induced subclass label vectors as target response values in our sparse regression model. In our experiments on the ADNI cohort, we performed both binary and multi-class classification tasks in AD/MCI diagnosis and showed the superiority of the proposed method by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.",0.5373978,0.56723017,0.5895112,0.5681005,0.55883354,0.53650004,0.52844876,0.5274619,0.539286,0.5795168,0.5714746,0.53869075,0.5575195,0.5766636,Deep sparse multi-task learning for feature selection in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis,6/1/2016,,Heung Il Suk; Seong Whan Lee; Dinggang Shen,Brain Structure and Function,117,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84929692240&origin=inward,,,,2569-2587,2016,"@article{,

However, these methods were assessed on different populations, making it difficult to compare their performance. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of ten approaches (five voxel-based methods, three methods based on cortical thickness and two methods based on the hippocampus) using 509 subjects from the ADNI database. Three classification experiments were performed: CN vs AD, CN vs MCIc (MCI who had converted to AD within 18. months, MCI converters - MCIc) and MCIc vs MCInc (MCI who had not converted to AD within 18. months, MCI non-converters - MCInc). Data from 81 CN, 67 MCInc, 39 MCIc and 69 AD were used for training and hyperparameters optimization. The remaining independent samples of 81 CN, 67 MCInc, 37 MCIc and 68 AD were used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the performance of the methods. For AD vs CN, whole-brain methods (voxel-based or cortical thickness-based) achieved high accuracies (up to 81% sensitivity and 95% specificity). For the detection of prodromal AD (CN vs MCIc), the sensitivity was substantially lower. For the prediction of conversion, no classifier obtained significantly better results than chance. We also compared the results obtained using the DARTEL registration to that using SPM5 unified segmentation. DARTEL significantly improved six out of 20 classification experiments and led to lower results in only two cases. Overall, the use of feature selection did not improve the performance but substantially increased the computation times. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",0.5522305,0.58516824,0.5946897,0.56205803,0.57973194,0.48983988,0.5710531,0.56605077,0.6131805,0.59215134,0.6017268,0.56132346,0.59801406,0.65539914,Automatic classification of patients with Alzheimer's disease from structural MRI: A comparison of ten methods using the ADNI database,5/15/2011,,Rémi Cuingnet; Emilie Gerardin; Jérôme Tessieras; Guillaume Auzias; Stéphane Lehéricy; Marie Odile Habert; Marie Chupin; Habib Benali; Olivier Colliot,NeuroImage,798,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79955059574&origin=inward,,,,766-781,2011,"@article{,

Classical approaches in visual information retrieval have been successfully used for analysis of structural MRI brain images. In this paper, we use the visual indexing framework and pattern recognition analysis based on structural MRI data to discriminate three classes of subjects: normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The approach uses the circular harmonic functions (CHFs) to extract local features from the most involved areas in the disease: hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in each slice in all three brain projections. The features are quantized using the Bag-of-Visual-Words approach to build one signature by brain (subject). This yields a transformation of a full 3D image of brain ROIs into a 1D signature, a histogram of quantized features. To reduce the dimensionality of the signature, we use the PCA technique. Support vector machines classifiers are then applied to classify groups. The experiments were conducted on a subset of ADNI dataset and applied to the ""Bordeaux-3City"" dataset. The results showed that our approach achieves respectively for ADNI dataset and ""Bordeaux-3City"" dataset; for AD vs NC classification, an accuracy of 83.77% and 78%, a specificity of 88.2% and 80.4% and a sensitivity of 79.09% and 74.7%. For NC vs MCI classification we achieved for the ADNI datasets an accuracy of 69.45%, a specificity of 74.8% and a sensitivity of 62.52%. For the most challenging classification task (AD vs MCI), we reached an accuracy of 62.07%, a specificity of 75.15% and a sensitivity of 49.02%. The use of PCC visual features description improves classification results by more than 5% compared to the use of hippocampus features only.

Previous learning based meth- ods defined the diagnosis process as a classification task and directly used the low-level features extracted from neu- roimaging data without considering relations among them. However, from a neuroscience point of view, it's well known that a human brain is a complex system that multiple brain regions are anatomically connected and functionally inter- act with each other. Therefore, it is natural to hypothesize that the low-level features extracted from neuroimaging da- ta are related to each other in some ways. To this end, in this paper, we first devise a coupled feature representa- tion by utilizing intra-coupled and inter-coupled interaction relationship. Regarding multi-modal data fusion, we pro- pose a novel coupled boosting algorithm that analyzes the pairwise coupled-diversity correlation between modalities. Specifically, we formulate a new weight updating function, which considers both incorrectly and inconsistently classi- fied samples.

Unlike the previous methods that considered simple low-level features such as gray matter tissue volumes from MRI, and mean signal intensities from PET, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based latent feature representation with a stacked auto-encoder (SAE). We believe that there exist latent non-linear complicated patterns inherent in the low-level features such as relations among features. Combining the latent information with the original features helps build a robust model in AD/MCI classification, with high diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, thanks to the unsupervised characteristic of the pre-training in deep learning, we can benefit from the target-unrelated samples to initialize parameters of SAE, thus finding optimal parameters in fine-tuning with the target-related samples, and further enhancing the classification performances across four binary classification problems: AD vs. healthy normal control (HC), MCI vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI converter (MCI-C) vs. MCI non-converter (MCI-NC). In our experiments on ADNI dataset, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing the accuracies of 98.8, 90.7, 83.7, and 83.3 % for AD/HC, MCI/HC, AD/MCI, and MCI-C/MCI-NC classification, respectively.

However, most of existing methods only use data from a single auxiliary domain, and thus cannot utilize the intrinsic useful correlation information from multiple domains. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the joint learning of tasks in multi-auxiliary domains and the target domain, and propose a novel Multi-Domain Transfer Learning (MDTL) framework for early diagnosis of AD. Specifically, the proposed MDTL framework consists of two key components: 1) a multi-domain transfer feature selection (MDTFS) model that selects the most informative feature subset from multi-domain data, and 2) a multi-domain transfer classification (MDTC) model that can identify disease status for early AD detection. We evaluate our method on 807 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

Since an ROI representation of brain structures is obtained either by pre-definition or by adaptive parcellation, the corresponding ROI in different brains can be measured. However, due to noise and small sample size of MRI images, representations generated from single or multiple ROIs may not be sufficient to reveal the underlying anatomical differences between the groups of disease-affected patients and health controls (HC).

The whole brain of each subject is divided into 90, 54, 14, and 1 regions based on Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. The connectivity between each pair of regions is computed in terms of Pearson's correlation coefficient and used as classification feature.

CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks.

We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers.

Data augmentation aims to generate additional data which is used to train the model and has been shown to improve performance when validated on a separate unseen dataset.

Witnessed by recent studies, functional connectivity is a useful concept in extracting brain network features and finding biomarkers for brain disease diagnosis. However, it still remains challenging for the estimation of functional connectivity from rs-fMRI due to the inevitable high dimensional problem. In order to tackle this problem, we utilize a group sparse representation along with a structural equation model. Unlike the conventional group sparse representation method that does not explicitly consider class-label information, which can help enhance the diagnostic performance, in this paper, we propose a novel supervised discriminative group sparse representation method by penalizing a large within-class variance and a small between-class variance of connectivity coefficients. Thanks to the newly devised penalization terms, we can learn connectivity coefficients that are similar within the same class and distinct between classes, thus helping enhance the diagnostic accuracy. The proposed method also allows the learned common network structure to preserve the network specific and label-related characteristics. In our experiments on the rs-fMRI data of 37 subjects (12 MCI; 25 healthy normal control) with a cross-validation technique, we demonstrated the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method, showing the diagnostic accuracy of 89.19 % and the sensitivity of 0.9167.",0.45863932,0.4874211,0.501665,0.48755696,0.45299917,0.40871713,0.41226783,0.40914512,0.47705257,0.46711692,0.465138,0.43326586,0.48014003,0.49608362,Supervised Discriminative Group Sparse Representation for Mild Cognitive Impairment Diagnosis,12/16/2015,,Heung Il Suk; Chong Yaw Wee; Seong Whan Lee; Dinggang Shen,Neuroinformatics,38,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84931011132&origin=inward,,,,277-295,2015,"@article{,

We compare and contrast the performance of two such approaches for AD detection on the recent ADReSS challenge dataset [1]: 1) using domain knowledge-based hand-crafted features that capture linguistic and acoustic phenomena, and 2) fine-tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT)based sequence classification models.

MRI modalities show patterns of brain damage that discriminate AD from other brain illnesses and brain abnormalities that are associated with risk of conversion to AD from MCI and other behavioural outcomes. This review discusses the application of various MRI techniques to and their clinical usefulness in AD and MCI. MRI modalities covered include structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labelling (ASL), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI).

A novel method to determine the salient regions of images is proposed in this paper. The L0 smoothing filter and principle component analysis (PCA) play important roles in our framework. The L0 filter is extremely helpful in characterizing fundamental image constituents, i.e., salient edges, and can simultaneously diminish insignificant details, thus producing more accurate boundary information for background merging and boundary scoring. PCA can reduce computational complexity as well as attenuate noise and translation errors. A local-global contrast is then used to calculate the distinction. Finally, image segmentation is used to achieve full-resolution saliency maps. The proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art saliency detection methods and shown to yield higher precision-recall rates and F-measures. © 2013 IEEE.",0.2505555,0.2738397,0.24796925,0.22312248,0.26616302,0.21835968,0.23253848,0.22502533,0.26766792,0.31728593,0.27854827,0.28533602,0.2859852,0.3252154,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found
1365,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcbb.2017.2731849,5.20E-05,8,5,"Several anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified. Cortical gray matter volume, cortical thickness, and subcortical volume have been used successfully to assist the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease including its early warning and developing stages, e.g., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) including MCI converted to AD (MCIc) and MCI not converted to AD (MCInc). Currently, these anatomical MRI measures have mainly been used separately. Thus, the full potential of anatomical MRI scans for AD diagnosis might not yet have been used optimally. Meanwhile, most studies currently only focused on morphological features of regions of interest (ROIs) or interregional features without considering the combination of them. To further improve the diagnosis of AD, we propose a novel approach of extracting ROI features and interregional features based on multiple measures from MRI images to distinguish AD, MCI (including MCIc and MCInc), and health control (HC). First, we construct six individual networks based on six different anatomical measures (i.e., CGMV, CT, CSA, CC, CFI, and SV) and Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas for each subject. Then, for each individual network, we extract all node (ROI) features and edge (interregional) features, and denoted as node feature set and edge feature set, respectively. Therefore, we can obtain six node feature sets and six edge feature sets from six different anatomical measures. Next, each feature within a feature set is ranked by $F$-score in descending order, and the top ranked features of each feature set are applied to MKBoost algorithm to obtain the best classification accuracy. After obtaining the best classification accuracy, we can get the optimal feature subset and the corresponding classifier for each node or edge feature set. Afterwards, to investigate the classification performance with only node features, we proposed a weighted multiple kernel learning (wMKL) framework to combine these six optimal node feature subsets, and obtain a combined classifier to perform AD classification. Similarly, we can obtain the classification performance with only edge features. Finally, we combine both six optimal node feature subsets and six optimal edge feature subsets to further improve the classification performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in AD classification, and demonstrate that different measures contain complementary information.",0.5812296,0.58984345,0.62316334,0.62697667,0.5216142,0.4687346,0.5008925,0.49338114,0.56439334,0.58274925,0.55051744,0.54566175,0.57147336,0.5857621,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

These anatomical MRI measures have so far mainly been used separately. The full potential of anatomical MRI scans for AD diagnosis might thus not yet have been used optimally. In this study, we therefore combined multiple anatomical MRI measures to improve diagnostic classification of AD. For 21 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 21 cognitively normal controls, we calculated (i) cortical thickness, (ii) cortical area, (iii) cortical curvature, (iv) grey matter density, (v) subcortical volumes, and (vi) hippocampal shape. These six measures were used separately and combined as predictors in an elastic net logistic regression.

Measures have been usually obtained with regions-of-interest (ROI) drawn manually on selected medial and lateral portions of the temporal lobes, with variable choices of anatomical borders across different studies. We used the fully automated voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach to investigate gray matter abnormalities over the entire extension of the temporal lobe in 14 AD patients (MMSE 14-25) and 14 healthy controls. Foci of significantly reduced gray matter volume in AD patients were detected in both medial and lateral temporal regions, most significantly in the right and left posterior parahippocampal gyri and the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus/fusiform gyrus (P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). At a more flexible statistical threshold (P<0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons), circumscribed foci of significant gray matter reduction were also detected in the right amygdala/enthorinal cortex, the anterior and posterior borders of the superior temporal gyrus bilaterally, and the anterior portion of the left middle temporal gyrus. These VBM results confirm previous findings of temporal lobe atrophic changes in AD, and suggest that these abnormalities may be confined to specific sites within that lobe, rather than showing a widespread distribution. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

At a single dementia clinic, we evaluated the ability of a linear support vector machine trained with completely unrelated data to differentiate between Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy body dementia, and healthy aging based on 3D-T1 weighted MRI data sets. Furthermore, we predicted progression to AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline and automatically quantified white matter hyperintensities from FLAIR-images. Separating additionally recruited healthy elderly from those with dementia was accurate with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 (according to Fig. 4). Multi-class separation of patients with either AD or FTD from other included groups was good on the training set (AUC > 0.9) but substantially less accurate (AUC= 0.76 for AD, AUC= 0.78 for FTD) on 134 cases from the local clinic. Longitudinal data from 28 cases with MCI at baseline and appropriate follow-up data were available. The computer tool discriminated progressive from stable MCI with AUC= 0.73, compared to AUC= 0.80 for the training set. A relatively low accuracy by clinicians (AUC= 0.81) illustrates the difficulties of predicting conversion in this heterogeneous cohort.

Traditional deformable simulation methods, such as the use of analytic deformation fields or the displacement of landmarks followed by some form of interpolation, are often unable to construct rich (complex) and/or realistic deformations of anatomical organs. This paper presents new methods aiming to automatically simulate realistic inter- and intra-individual deformations. The paper first describes a statistical approach to capturing inter-individual variability of high-deformation fields from a number of examples (training samples). In this approach, Wavelet-Packet Transform (WPT) of the training deformations and their Jacobians, in conjunction with a Markov random field (MRF) spatial regularization, are used to capture both coarse and fine characteristics of the training deformations in a statistical fashion. Simulated deformations can then be constructed by randomly sampling the resultant statistical distribution in an unconstrained or a landmark-constrained fashion. The paper also describes a model for generating tissue atrophy or growth in order to simulate intra-individual brain deformations. Several sets of simulated deformation fields and respective images are generated, which can be used in the future for systematic and extensive validation studies of automated atlas-based segmentation and deformable registration methods.

Its early diagnosis is thus drawn the attention of researchers and physicians. This study aims to investigate various types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) used to diagnose and predict AD based on brain images of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, articles indexed in the IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, and PubMed Central databases were systematically analyzed over the period from 2010 through the first half of 2020. The initial search was done for the keywords Alzheimer’s, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neural network, continued for the keywords Alzheimer’s, brain positron emission tomography(PET), and neural network, and ended with the keywords Alzheimer’s, brain computed tomography (CT), and neural network. Eventually, the most relevant articles were selected based on the critical evaluation of the subject under investigation. Searching on the subject through the mentioned databases resulted in 900 articles. Excluding unrelated ones, only 134 articles remained, out of which, 54, 41, 35, and 4 numbers were respectively indexed in PubMed Central, Elsevier, Springer, and IEEE databases.

In large-scale studies involving a significant number of subjects, a fully automatic method is highly desirable, since manual skull-stripping requires tremendous human effort and can be inconsistent even after sufficient training. We propose in this paper a robust and effective method that is capable of skull-stripping a large number of images accurately with minimal dependence on the parameter setting. The key of our method involves an initial skull-stripping by co-registration of an atlas, followed by a refinement phase with a surface deformation scheme that is guided by prior information obtained from a set of real brain images. Evaluation based on a total of 831 images, consisting of normal controls (NC) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD), from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database indicates that our method performs favorably at a consistent overall overlap rate of approximately 98% when compared with expert results.

To identify and choose effective and personalized strategies to prevent or slow the progression of AD, we need to develop objective measures that are able to discriminate the MCI patients who are at risk of AD from those MCI patients who have less risk to develop AD. Here, we present a novel deep learning architecture, based on dual learning and an ad hoc layer for 3D separable convolutions, which aims at identifying MCI patients who have a high likelihood of developing AD within 3 years. Our deep learning procedures combine structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 genetic data as input measures. The most novel characteristics of our machine learning model compared to previous ones are the following: 1) our deep learning model is multi-tasking, in the sense that it jointly learns to simultaneously predict both MCI to AD conversion as well as AD vs. healthy controls classification, which facilitates relevant feature extraction for AD prognostication; 2) the neural network classifier employs fewer parameters than other deep learning architectures which significantly limits data-overfitting (we use ∼550,000 network parameters, which is orders of magnitude lower than other network designs); 3) both structural MRI images and their warp field characteristics, which quantify local volumetric changes in relation to the MRI template, were used as separate input streams to extract as much information as possible from the MRI data. All analyses were performed on a subset of the database made publicly available via the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), (n = 785 participants, n = 192 AD patients, n = 409 MCI patients (including both MCI patients who convert to AD and MCI patients who do not covert to AD), and n = 184 healthy controls). The most predictive combination of inputs were the structural MRI images and the demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 data. In contrast, the warp field metrics were of little added predictive value. The algorithm was able to distinguish the MCI patients developing AD within 3 years from those patients with stable MCI over the same time-period with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.925 and a 10-fold cross-validated accuracy of 86%, a sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 85%. To our knowledge, this is the highest performance achieved so far using similar datasets. The same network provided an AUC of 1 and 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when classifying patients with AD from healthy controls. Our classification framework was also robust to the use of different co-registration templates and potentially irrelevant features/image portions. Our approach is flexible and can in principle integrate other imaging modalities, such as PET, and diverse other sets of clinical data. The convolutional framework is potentially applicable to any 3D image dataset and gives the flexibility to design a computer-aided diagnosis system targeting the prediction of several medical conditions and neuropsychiatric disorders via multi-modal imaging and tabular clinical data.",0.5604077,0.5926404,0.61065733,0.6075567,0.60230446,0.57912207,0.57041204,0.5622057,0.57675683,0.6236283,0.6383251,0.5803978,0.6430829,0.6294145,A parameter-efficient deep learning approach to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease,4/1/2019,,Simeon Spasov; Luca Passamonti; Andrea Duggento; Pietro Liò; Nicola Toschi,NeuroImage,265,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060300289&origin=inward,,,,276-287,2019,"@article{,

Recent efforts have now started investigating their utility for diagnosis purposes. This line of research has shown promising results where methods from machine learning (such as Support Vector Machines) have been used to identify AD-related patterns from images, for use in diagnosing new individual subjects. In this paper, we propose a new framework for AD classification which makes use of the Linear Program (LP) boosting with novel additional regularization based on spatial ""smoothness"" in 3D image coordinate spaces. The algorithm formalizes the expectation that since the examples for training the classifier are images, the voxels eventually selected for specifying the decision boundary must constitute spatially contiguous chunks, i.e., ""regions"" must be preferred over isolated voxels. This prior belief turns out to be useful for significantly reducing the space of possible classifiers and leads to substantial benefits in generalization. In our method, the requirement of spatial contiguity (of selected discriminating voxels) is incorporated within the optimization framework directly. Other methods have made use of similar biases as a pre- or post-processing step, however, our model incorporates this emphasis on spatial smoothness directly into the learning step. We report on extensive evaluations of our algorithm on MR and FDG-PET images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and discuss the relationship of the classification output with the clinical and cognitive biomarker data available within ADNI. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, the proposed approach is capable of identifying AD patients in early stages. The dataset selected consists of 85 age and gender matched individuals from OASIS database. The features selected are volume of GM, WM, and CSF and size of hippocampus. Three different classification models (SVM, MLP, and J48) are used for identification of patients and controls. In addition, an ensemble of classifiers, based on majority voting, is adopted to overcome the error caused by an independent base classifier. Ten-fold cross validation strategy is applied for the evaluation of our scheme. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of proposed approach, individual features and combination of features are fed to individual classifiers and ensemble based classifier.

The success of computer-aided diagnosis methods using structural MRI data is largely dependent on the two time-consuming steps: 1) nonlinear registration across subjects, and 2) brain tissue segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a landmark-based feature extraction method that does not require nonlinear registration and tissue segmentation. In the training stage, in order to distinguish AD subjects from healthy controls (HCs), group comparisons, based on local morphological features, are first performed to identify brain regions that have significant group differences. In general, the centers of the identified regions become landmark locations (or AD landmarks for short) capable of differentiating AD subjects from HCs. In the testing stage, using the learned AD landmarks, the corresponding landmarks are detected in a testing image using an efficient technique based on a shape-constrained regression-forest algorithm. To improve detection accuracy, an additional set of salient and consistent landmarks are also identified to guide the AD landmark detection. Based on the identified AD landmarks, morphological features are extracted to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that is capable of predicting the AD condition. In the experiments, our method is evaluated on landmark detection and AD classification sequentially. Specifically, the landmark detection error (manually annotated versus automatically detected) of the proposed landmark detector is $2.41 mm$ , and our landmark-based AD classification accuracy is 83.7%. Lastly, the AD classification performance of our method is comparable to, or even better than, that achieved by existing region-based and voxel-based methods, while the proposed method is approximately 50 times faster.",0.5390625,0.52408886,0.5319948,0.5420895,0.53113586,0.47228378,0.47527248,0.46603566,0.52337015,0.51889795,0.5200871,0.5195197,0.506766,0.5917871,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

MRI was collected in 32 AD patients, 24 MCI subjects and 18 healthy controls (HC). Nine out of 24 MCI subjects converted to AD after an average follow-up interval of 2.5 years. Using feature selection algorithms, brain regions showing the highest accuracy for the discrimination between AD and HC were identified, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 92%. The extracted AD clusters were used as a search region to extract those brain areas that are predictive of conversion to AD within MCI subjects. The most predictive brain areas included the anterior cingulate gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex. The best prediction accuracy, which was cross-validated via train-and-test, was 75% for the prediction of the conversion from MCI to AD.

Cognitive stimulation is an emerging intervention in the field of neurology and allied sciences, having already been shown to improve cognition in subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Yet no studies have attempted to unravel the brain mechanisms that support such improvement. This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the effect of memory training on brain activation in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and to assess whether it can reverse the brain changes associated with mild cognitive impairment. Brain activation associated with verbal encoding and retrieval was recorded twice prior to training and once after training. In subjects with mild cognitive impairment, increased activation was found after training within a large network that included the frontal, temporal and parietal areas. Healthy controls showed mostly areas of decreased activation following training. Comparison with pre-training indicated that subjects with mild cognitive impairment used a combination of specialized areas; that is, areas activated prior to training and new alternative areas activated following training. However, only activation of the right inferior parietal lobule, a new area of activation, correlated with performance. Furthermore, the differences between the brain activation patterns of subjects with mild cognitive impairment and those of healthy controls were attenuated by training in a number of brain regions.

Research efforts in the area of diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease have used various aspects of computer-aided multi-class diagnosis approaches with varied degrees of success. However, there is still need for more efficient and reliable approaches to successful diagnosis of the disease. This research used deep learning framework with modified k-sparse autoencoder (oKSA) classification to locate neutrally degenerated areas of the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), low amyloid beta 1-42 imaging in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid; each with a sample of 150 images. Results show a correlation between computational demarcation of infected regions and the images. Degeneration in the studied areas was evidenced by high phosphorylated t-/p-tau levels in CSF, regional fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and the presence of atrophy patterns. The use of oKSA algorithm in boosting classification helped to improve the classifier performance. The KSA method with deep learning framework is used for the first time to produce accurate results in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",0.5925957,0.5644419,0.59817094,0.5926028,0.5540675,0.5782901,0.520184,0.51719284,0.56515574,0.5987685,0.6043681,0.5660644,0.5845812,0.6025318,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

We present a methodology for predicting yearly Mini-Mental Score Examination (MMSE) changes in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients. We begin by generating a non-pathological, multidimensional reference space from a group of 152 healthy volunteers by Principal Component Analyses of (i) T1w MR intensity of linearly registered Volumes of Interest (VOI); and (ii) trace of the deformation fields of nonlinearly registered VOIs. We use multiple regression to build linear models from eigenvectors where the projection eigencoordinates of patient data in the reference space are highly correlated with the clinical variable of interest. In our cohort of 47 MCI patients, composed of 16 decliners, 26 stable and 5 improvers (based on MMSE at 1 yr follow-up), there was a significant difference (P = 0.0003) for baseline MMSE scores between decliners and improvers, but no other differences based on age or sex. First, we classified our three groups using leave-one-out, forward stepwise linear discriminant analyses of the projection eigencoordinates with 100% accuracy. Next, we compared various linear models by computing F-statistics on the residuals of predicted vs actual values. The best model was based on 10 eigenvectors + baseline MMSE, with predicted yearly changes highly correlated (r = 0.6955) with actual data.

Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, information fusion strategies with multi-modal neuroimaging data, such as voxel-based measures extracted from structural MRI (VBM-MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have shown their effectiveness for AD diagnosis. However, most existing methods are proposed to simply integrate the multi-modal data, but do not make full use of structure information across the different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal neuroimaging feature selection method with consistent metric constraint (MFCC) for AD analysis. First, the similarity is calculated for each modality (i.e. VBM-MRI or FDG-PET) individually by random forest strategy, which can extract pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities. Then the group sparsity regularization term and the sample similarity constraint regularization term are used to constrain the objective function to conduct feature selection from multiple modalities. Finally, the multi-kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is used to fuse the features selected from different models for final classification. The experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show that the proposed method has better classification performance than the start-of-the-art multimodality-based methods. Specifically, we achieved higher accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for AD versus normal controls (NC), MCI versus NC, and MCI converters (MCI-C) versus MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) on ADNI datasets. Therefore, the proposed model not only outperforms the traditional method in terms of AD/MCI classification, but also discovers the characteristics associated with the disease, demonstrating its promise for improving disease-related mechanistic understanding.",0.5375208,0.5891581,0.6353616,0.6697884,0.5258219,0.4775682,0.5002362,0.49934235,0.54246676,0.56328696,0.5425042,0.52432656,0.55545574,0.5888958,Multi-modal neuroimaging feature selection with consistent metric constraint for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,2/1/2020,,Xiaoke Hao; Yongjin Bao; Yingchun Guo; Ming Yu; Daoqiang Zhang; Shannon L.

Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information.

Most of current studies formulate the AD diagnosis scenario as a classification problem and solve it using various machine learners trained with multi-modal biomarkers. However, the diagnosis accuracy is usually constrained by the performance of the machine learners as well as the methods of integrating the multi-modal data. In this study, we propose a novel diagnosis algorithm, the Multifold Bayesian Kernelization (MBK), which models the diagnosis process as a synthesis analysis of multi-modal biomarkers. MBK constructs a kernel for each biomarker that maximizes the local neighborhood affinity, and further evaluates the contribution of each biomarker based on a Bayesian framework. MBK adopts a novel diagnosis scheme that could infer the subject's diagnosis by synthesizing the output diagnosis probabilities of individual biomarkers.

Hippocampus volume (HV), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau (pTau), and the FDG t-sum score in an AD meta-region-of-interest were compared as neurodegeneration markers. CSF-Aβ1-42 was used as amyloidosis marker. The incremental prognostic benefit from these markers was assessed by stepwise Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in 402 ADNI MCI subjects. Predefined cutoffs were used to dichotomize patients as 'negative' or 'positive' for AD characteristic alteration with respect to each marker. Among the neurodegeneration markers, CSF-pTau provided the best incremental risk stratification when added to ADAS-13. FDG PET outperformed HV only in MCI subjects with relatively preserved cognition. Adding CSF-Aβ provided further risk stratification in pTau-positive subjects, independent of their cognitive status.

We combined volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques in a cross-sectional study including 30 a-MCI, 30 AD patients, and 30 age-matched CTRL. We employed a fully automated model-based segmentation algorithm on 3 Tesla MRI anatomical images and accurate coregistration of DTI to anatomical images to extract regional values of DTI parameters. Both the hippocampi significantly and progressively decreased in volume from CTRL through MCI to AD. Both the thalami showed a progressive and significant decrease in volume from CTRL to AD. Mean diffusivity (MD) values increased progressively across the three groups in the bilateral hippocampus, amygdala, and in the right caudate. No differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) values were found. Two distinct but overlapping patterns of progression of structural (i.e., atrophy) and microstructural (i.e., MD increase) damage were observed. Particularly, the pattern of atrophy was mirrored by the increasing value of the averaged MD, which provided a further indicator of subtle tissue disruption in the hippocampal structure in mild AD patients.

The move to diagnose people suffering from AD at an earlier stage has been a daunting problem in mental health. In recent years, the advancement of deep learning in the likes of convolutional neural networks (CNN) has made a great effort towards an early detection of AD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, due to the need for highly discriminative features from MR images, it is still challenging to accurately use CNNs by training from scratch for early detection of AD. This paper aims to improve the early detection of Alzheimer's disease using deep learning for neuroimaging data. We have utilized the SqueezeNet, ResNet18, AlexNet, Vgg11, DenseNet, and InceptionV3 pre-trained models to automatically classify MR images. To validate our model, we experimented with the MR images obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. The average classification accuracy derived by SqueezeNet model for training and testing was 99.38% and 82.53% for binary class and multiclass, respectively.",0.54857886,0.5404647,0.5713908,0.56111205,0.6130871,0.56752026,0.5410905,0.54212636,0.55792314,0.6126514,0.63317627,0.5855871,0.639643,0.6074224,Comparable Study of Pre-trained Model on Alzheimer Disease Classification,1/1/2021,,Modupe Odusami; Rytis Maskeliunas; Robertas Damaševičius; Sanjay Misra,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85115679934&origin=inward,,,,63-74,2021,"@article{,

To validate this approach for the most frequent dementia syndrome AD, and to test its applicability to multicenter data, we randomly extracted FDG-PET and MRI data of 28 AD patients and 28 healthy control subjects from the database provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and compared them to data of 21 patients with AD and 13 control subjects from our own Leipzig cohort. SVM classification using combined volume-of-interest information from FDG-PET and MRI based on comprehensive quantitative meta-analyses investigating dementia syndromes revealed a higher discrimination accuracy in comparison to single modality classification. For the ADNI dataset accuracy rates of up to 88% and for the Leipzig cohort of up to 100% were obtained. Classifiers trained on the ADNI data discriminated the Leipzig cohorts with an accuracy of 91%. In conclusion, our results suggest SVM classification based on quantitative meta-analyses of multicenter data as a valid method for individual AD diagnosis. Furthermore, combining imaging information from MRI and FDG-PET might substantially improve the accuracy of AD diagnosis. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",0.5480503,0.6208674,0.6345071,0.667792,0.55254173,0.48997253,0.50228626,0.5049341,0.56406784,0.57405394,0.55239975,0.5139559,0.5471048,0.6305746,Meta-analysis based SVM classification enables accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease across different clinical centers using FDG-PET and MRI,6/30/2013,,Juergen Dukart; Karsten Mueller; Henryk Barthel; Arno Villringer; Osama Sabri; Matthias Leopold Schroeter,Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging,115,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84878119051&origin=inward,,,,230-236,2013,"@article{,

Exploring the longitudinal trajectory of markers related to neurodegeneration is an important task when selecting subjects for treatment in trials and the clinic, in the evaluation of early disease indicators and the monitoring of disease progression. Given that there is substantial intersubject variability, models that attempt to describe marker trajectories for a whole population will likely lack specificity for the representation of individual patients. Therefore, we argue here that individualized models provide a more accurate alternative that can be used for tasks such as population stratification and a subject-specific prognosis. In the work presented here, mixed effects modeling is used to derive global and individual marker trajectories for a training population. Test subject (new patient) specific models are then instantiated using a stratified “marker signature” that defines a subpopulation of similar cases within the training database. From this subpopulation, personalized models of the expected trajectory of several markers are subsequently estimated for unseen patients. These patient specific models of markers are shown to provide better predictions of time-to-conversion to Alzheimer's disease than population based models.",0.46616045,0.5138902,0.5758734,0.5008654,0.47586372,0.5045755,0.47382832,0.4467114,0.5204043,0.4337762,0.478515,0.45267993,0.4365724,0.47120592,Instantiated mixed effects modeling of Alzheimer's disease markers,11/15/2016,,R.

Because it is a neurodegenerative condition, Alzheimer's disease seems to have a long incubation period. Therefore, it is essential to analyze Alzheimer's symptoms at different stages. In this paper, the classification is done with several methods of machine learning consisting of K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), linear discrimination analysis (LDA), and random forest (RF). Moreover, novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is presented to diagnose Alzheimer's severity. The relationship between Alzheimer's patients' functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) images and their scores on the MMSE is investigated to achieve the aim. The feature extraction is performed based on the robust multitask feature learning algorithm. The severity is also calculated based on the Mini-Mental State Examination score, including low, mild, moderate, and severe categories. Results show that the accuracy of the KNN, SVM, DT, LDA, RF, and presented CNN method is 77.5%, 85.8%, 91.7%, 79.5%, 85.1%, and 96.7%, respectively. Moreover, for the presented CNN architecture, the sensitivity of low, mild, moderate, and severe status of Alzheimer patients is 98.1%, 95.2%,89.0%, and 87.5%, respectively.

The characterization of this sort of connectivity is an important theme in many areas of neuroscience. This article presents one approach that has been used in functional imaging. This article reviews the basic distinction between functional and effective connectivity (as the terms are used in neuroimaging) and their role in addressing several aspects of functional organization (e.g. the topography of distributed system, integration between cortical areas, time‐dependent changes in connectivity and nonlinear interactions). Emphasis is placed on the points of contact between the apparently diverse applications of these concepts and in particular the central role of eigenimages or spatial modes.

AD is a form of dementia, and the symptoms include memory loss and decision-making difficulties. Current advanced diagnostic modalities are costly or unable to detect the histopathological features of AD. Hence a computational intelligence tool (CIT) for AD diagnosis is proposed in this study. The magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain are pre-processed using an adaptive histogram, and decomposed into four IMFS using bidirectional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD). Local binary patterns (LBP) are then computed per IMF, and the histograms are concatenated. Adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) is applied to balance the dataset and Student's t-test is utilized for selection of highly significant features, within each fold for ten-fold validation.

These populations come from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

Statistical analysis based approaches has been widely employed for this purpose which are comprised of four stages such as pre-processing, feature extraction, feature reduction and classification. The outcome of such approaches are highly dependent upon the image quality: better the image, higher the outcome. In this paper, we present a hypothesis that the quality of the image, which is enhanced at the pre-processing stage, can play a significant role in enhancing the classification performance of any statistical approach. To strengthen our theory we first employed an improved image enhancement technique, which consists of three different sub-stages: noise removal using median filter, contrast enhancement using histogram equalization technique and image conversion from gray-scale to RGB. After image enhancement, we extract features from an enhanced MR brain image using a discrete wavelet transform and these feature are further reduced by color moments i.e mean, standard deviation, and skewness. Finally, we trained an advanced deep neural network (DNN) to categorize the human brain MRI images as normal or pathological. The approach obtained 95.8% which is significantly higher than the previous state-of-the-art techniques.

Recent studies have shown great promise for improving the performance of MCI classification by combining multiple structural and functional features, such as grey matter volume and clustering coefficient. However, extracting which features and how to combine multiple features to improve the performance of MCI classification have always been challenging problems. To address these problems, in this study we propose a new method to enhance the feature representation of multi-modal MRI data by combining multi-view information to improve the performance of MCI classification. Firstly, we extract two structural features (including grey matter volume and cortical thickness) and two functional features (including clustering coefficient and shortest path length) of each cortical brain region based on automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas from both T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data of each subject. Then, in order to obtain features that are more helpful in distinguishing MCI subjects, an improved multi-task feature selection method, namely MTFS-gLASSO-TTR, is proposed. Finally, a multi-kernel learning algorithm is adopted to combine multiple features to perform the MCI classification task. Our proposed MCI classification method is evaluated on 315 subjects (including 105 LMCI subjects, 105 EMCI subjects and 105 NCs) with both T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.5% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.897 for LMCI/NC classification, an accuracy of 82.7% and an AUC of 0.832 for EMCI/NC classification, and an accuracy of 79.6% and an AUC of 0.803 for LMCI/EMCI classification, respectively. In addition, by comparison, the accuracy and AUC values of our proposed method are better than those of some existing state-of-the-art methods in MCI classification.

Yet to date, the adoption rate of PET/MRI systems has been rather slow. This seems to be partially caused by the high costs of PET/MRI systems and the need to verify an incremental benefit over PET/CT or sequential PET/CT and MRI. In analogy to PET/CT, the MRI part of PET/MRI was primarily used for anatomical imaging. Though this can be advantageous, for example in diseases where the superior soft tissue contrast of MRI is highly appreciated, the sole use of MRI for anatomical orientation lessens the potential of PET/MRI. Consequently, more recent studies focused on its multiparametric potential and employed diffusion weighted sequences and other functional imaging sequences in PET/MRI. This integration puts the focus on a more wholesome approach to PET/MR imaging, in terms of releasing its full potential for local primary staging based on multiparametric imaging and an included one-stop shop approach for whole-body staging. This approach as well as the implementation of computational analysis, in terms of radiomics analysis, has been shown valuable in several oncological diseases, as will be discussed in this review article.",0.28493878,0.39030698,0.39701524,0.58068144,0.28947562,0.29312983,0.26025662,0.24343057,0.30669996,0.33793333,0.31409878,0.31495073,0.2874543,0.32854813,Clinical Use of PET/MR in Oncology: An Update,5/1/2022,,Robert Seifert; David Kersting; Christoph Rischpler; Marcel Opitz; Julian Kirchner; Kim M.

Recently, the construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed to designate an early, but abnormal, state of cognitive impairment. MCI has generated a great deal of research from both clinical and research perspectives. Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the accelerated rate of progression to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in MCI subjects and certain predictor variables appear valid. However, there has been controversy regarding the precise definition of the concept and its implementation in various clinical settings. Clinical subtypes of MCI have been proposed to broaden the concept and include prodromal forms of a variety of dementias. It is suggested that the diagnosis of MCI can be made in a fashion similar to the clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD. An algorithm is presented to assist the clinician in identifying subjects and subclassifying them into the various types of MCI.

Although deep learning has a good effect on feature extraction, the current deep learning methods usually need to set a large number of parameters manually, which is time consuming. Hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) needs only less manual intervention and can extract features by a multi-layer feature representation framework, which is much faster than the traditional deep learning methods. A CADx framework based on H-ELM, named DCADx, is proposed. As common spatial pattern (CSP) and brain functional network (BFN) have been proven to have better de-redundancy effects on brain data, the DCADx contains two different data redundancy reduction methods: (1) CSP-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-CSP model) and (2) BFN-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-BFN model). The experimental evaluation proved the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The DCADx-CSP model obtained 83.2% on Alzheimer’s disease and 82.5% on Parkinson’s disease. The DCADx-BFN obtained 89.3% on Alzheimer’s disease and 88.7% on Parkinson’s disease. DCADx can make full use of the feature expression ability of H-ELM to achieve better performance.

Neuropathology and structural MRI studies have pointed to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) as the brain region earliest affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MRI findings provide strong evidence that in mild cognitive impairments (MCI), AD-related volume losses can be reproducibly detected in the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex (EC) and, to a lesser extent, the parahippocampal gyrus; they also indicate that lateral temporal lobe changes are becoming increasingly useful in predicting the transition to dementia. Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging has revealed glucose metabolic reductions in the parieto-temporal, frontal and posterior cingulate cortices to be the hallmark of AD. Overall, the pattern of cortical metabolic changes has been useful for the prediction of future AD as well as in distinguishing AD from other neurodegenerative diseases. FDG-PET on average achieves 90% sensitivity in identifying AD, although specificity in differentiating AD from other dementias is lower. Moreover, recent MRI-guided FDG-PET studies have shown that MTL hypometabolism is the most specific and sensitive measure for the identification of MCI, while the utility of cortical deficits is controversial. This review highlights cross-sectional, prediction and longitudinal FDG-PET studies and attempts to put into perspective the value of FDG-PET in diagnosing AD-like changes, particularly at an early stage, and in providing diagnostic specificity. The examination of MTL structures, which has so far been exclusive to MRI protocols, is then examined as a possible strategy to improve diagnostic specificity. All told, there is considerable promise that early and specific diagnosis is feasible through a combination of imaging modalities. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",0.4789713,0.4921009,0.47983906,0.57073045,0.44098452,0.45112008,0.4168513,0.41134304,0.47213483,0.4544249,0.46332574,0.46154827,0.44723433,0.48958117,Brain glucose metabolism in the early and specific diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: FDG-PET studies in MCI and AD,4/1/2005,,Lisa Mosconi,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,719,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=17844364259&origin=inward,,,,486-510,2005,"@article{,

In the past decade,computational approaches on longitudinal image sequences have been actively investigated with special attention to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),which is an intermediate stage between normal control (NC) and AD. However,current state-of-the-art diagnosis methods have limited power in clinical practice,due to the excessive requirements such as equal and immoderate number of scans in longitudinal imaging data. More critically,very few methods are specifically designed for the early alarm of AD uptake. To address these limitations,we propose a flexible spatial-temporal solution for early detection of AD by recognizing abnormal structure changes from longitudinal MR image sequence. Specifically,our method is leveraged by the non-reversible nature of AD progression. We employ temporally structured SVM to accurately alarm AD at early stage by enforcing the monotony on classification result to avoid unrealistic and inconsistent diagnosis result along time. Furthermore,in order to select best features which can well collaborate with the classifier,we present as joint feature selection and classification framework. The evaluation on more than 150 longitudinal subjects from ADNI dataset shows that our method is able to alarm the conversion of AD 12 months prior to the clinical diagnosis with at least 82.5 % accuracy.

Earlier detection and proper treatment of Alzheimer’s disease can help for brain tissue damage prevention. The study was intended to explore the segmentation effects of convolutional neural network (CNN) model on Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging for Alzheimer's diagnosis and nursing. Specifically, 18 Alzheimer's patients admitted to Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) hospital were selected as the experimental group, with 18 healthy volunteers in the Ctrl group. Furthermore, the CNN model was applied to segment the MR imaging of Alzheimer's patients, and its segmentation effects were compared with those of the fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. It was found that the CNN model demonstrated higher segmentation precision, and the experimental group showed a higher clinical dementia rating (CDR) score and a lower mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score (P < 0.05). The size of parahippocompalgyrus and putamen was bigger in the Ctrl (P < 0.05). In experimental group, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was positively correlated with the MMSE score in areas of bilateral cingulum gyri (r = 0.65) and precuneus (r = 0.59). In conclusion, the grey matter structure is damaged in Alzheimer's patients, and hippocampus ALFF and regional homogeneity (ReHo) is involved in the neuronal compensation mechanism of hippocampal damage, and the caregivers should take an active nursing method.

Two of the most relevant issues are related to missing data and results interpretability. To deal with both issues, we introduce a methodology to predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment patients to Alzheimer's from structural brain MRI volumes. First, we use morphological measures of each brain structure to build an instance-based feature mapping that copes with missed follow-up visits. Then, the extracted multiple feature mappings are combined into a single representation through the convex combination of reproducing kernels. The weighting parameters per structure are tuned based on the maximization of the centered-kernel alignment criterion. We evaluate the proposed methodology on a couple of well-known classification machines employing the ADNI database devoted to assessing the combined prognostic value of several AD biomarkers. The obtained experimental results show that our proposed method of Instance-based representation using multiple kernel learning enables detecting mild cognitive impairment as well as predicting conversion to Alzheimers disease within three years from the initial screening.

This work presents a deep learning model to detect early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease using synchronization measures obtained with magnetoencephalography. The proposed model is a novel deep learning architecture based on an ensemble of randomized blocks formed by a sequence of 2D-convolutional, batch-normalization and pooling layers. An important challenge is to avoid overfitting, as the number of features is very high (25755) compared to the number of samples (132 patients). To address this issue the model uses an ensemble of identical sub-models all sharing weights, with a final stage that performs an average across sub-models. To facilitate the exploration of the feature space, each sub-model receives a random permutation of features. The features correspond to magnetic signals reflecting neural activity and are arranged in a matrix structure interpreted as a 2D image that is processed by 2D convolutional networks. The proposed detection model is a binary classifier (disease/non-disease), which compared to other deep learning architectures and classic machine learning classifiers, such as random forest and support vector machine, obtains the best classification performance results with an average F1-score of 0.92.

Here we explored the ability of a multitude of linear and non-linear classification algorithms to discriminate between the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of patients with varying degree of AD and their age-matched control subjects. Absolute and relative spectral power, distribution of spectral power, and measures of spatial synchronization were calculated from recordings of resting eyes-closed continuous EEGs of 45 healthy controls, 116 patients with mild AD and 81 patients with moderate AD, recruited in two different centers (Stockholm, New York). The applied classification algorithms were: principal component linear discriminant analysis (PC LDA), partial least squares LDA (PLS LDA), principal component logistic regression (PC LR), partial least squares logistic regression (PLS LR), bagging, random forest, support vector machines (SVM) and feed-forward neural network. Based on 10-fold cross-validation runs it could be demonstrated that even tough modern computer-intensive classification algorithms such as random forests, SVM and neural networks show a slight superiority, more classical classification algorithms performed nearly equally well. Using random forests classification a considerable sensitivity of up to 85% and a specificity of 78%, respectively for the test of even only mild AD patients has been reached, whereas for the comparison of moderate AD vs. controls, using SVM and neural networks, values of 89% and 88% for sensitivity and specificity were achieved.

It can be seen from cross-sectional imaging studies of AD that the features of the lesion areas in AD patients, as observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), show significant variation, and these features are distributed throughout the image space. Since the convolutional layer of the general convolutional neural network (CNN) cannot satisfactorily extract long-distance correlation in the feature space, a deep residual network (ResNet) model, based on spatial transformer networks (STN) and the non-local attention mechanism, is proposed in this study for the early diagnosis of AD. In this ResNet model, a new Mish activation function is selected in the ResNet-50 backbone to replace the Relu function, STN is introduced between the input layer and the improved ResNet-50 backbone, and a non-local attention mechanism is introduced between the fourth and the fifth stages of the improved ResNet-50 backbone. This ResNet model can extract more information from the layers by deepening the network structure through deep ResNet. The introduced STN can transform the spatial information in MRI images of Alzheimer’s patients into another space and retain the key information. The introduced non-local attention mechanism can find the relationship between the lesion areas and normal areas in the feature space. This model can solve the problem of local information loss in traditional CNN and can extract the long-distance correlation in feature space. The proposed method was validated using the ADNI (Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative) experimental dataset, and compared with several models. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the algorithm proposed in this study can reach 97.1%, the macro precision can reach 95.5%, the macro recall can reach 95.3%, and the macro F1 value can reach 95.4%.

In particular, we use machine learning to quantify interactions between key pathological markers (β-amyloid, medial temporal lobe atrophy, tau and APOE 4) at mildly impaired and asymptomatic stages of AD.

Towards this end, various computational approaches have been applied to longitudinal imaging data in subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), as serial brain imaging could increase sensitivity for detecting changes from baseline, and potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker for AD. However, current state-of-the-art brain imaging diagnostic methods have limited utility in clinical practice due to the lack of robust predictive power. To address this limitation, we propose a flexible spatial-temporal solution to predict the risk of MCI conversion to AD prior to the onset of clinical symptoms by sequentially recognizing abnormal structural changes from longitudinal magnetic resonance (MR) image sequences. Firstly, our model is trained to sequentially recognize different length partial MR image sequences from different stages of AD. Secondly, our method is leveraged by the inexorably progressive nature of AD. To that end, a Temporally Structured Support Vector Machine (TS-SVM) model is proposed to constrain the partial MR image sequence's detection score to increase monotonically with AD progression. Furthermore, in order to select the best morphological features for enabling classifiers, we propose a joint feature selection and classification framework.

The current study aims to compare and combine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the two study cohorts using an automated image analysis pipeline and a multivariate data analysis approach. We hypothesized that the two cohorts would show similar patterns of atrophy, despite demographic differences and could therefore be combined. MRI scans were analyzed from a total of 1074 subjects (AD = 295, MCI = 444 and controls = 335) using Freesurfer, an automated segmentation scheme which generates regional volume and regional cortical thickness measures which were subsequently used for multivariate analysis (orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS)). OPLS models were created for the individual cohorts and for the combined cohort to discriminate between AD patients and controls. The ADNI cohort was used as a replication dataset to validate the model created for the AddNeuroMed cohort and vice versa. The combined cohort model was used to predict conversion to AD at baseline of MCI subjects at 1. year follow-up. The AddNeuroMed, the ADNI and the combined cohort showed similar patterns of atrophy and the predictive power was similar (between 80 and 90%). The combined model also showed potential in predicting conversion from MCI to AD, resulting in 71% of the MCI converters (MCI-c) from both cohorts classified as AD-like and 60% of the stable MCI subjects (MCI-s) classified as control-like.

However, multi-modality based AD diagnostic models are often hindered by the missing data, i.e., not all the subjects have complete multi-modality data. One simple solution used by many previous studies is to discard samples with missing modalities. However, this significantly reduces the number of training samples, thus leading to a sub-optimal classification model. Furthermore, when building the classification model, most existing methods simply concatenate features from different modalities into a single feature vector without considering their underlying associations. As features from different modalities are often closely related (e.g., MRI and PET features are extracted from the same brain region), utilizing their inter-modality associations may improve the robustness of the diagnostic model. To this end, we propose a novel latent representation learning method for multi-modality based AD diagnosis. Specifically, we use all the available samples (including samples with incomplete modality data) to learn a latent representation space. Within this space, we not only use samples with complete multi-modality data to learn a common latent representation, but also use samples with incomplete multi-modality data to learn independent modality-specific latent representations. We then project the latent representations to the label space for AD diagnosis. We perform experiments using 737 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.",0.52951354,0.6000549,0.62640727,0.6769798,0.5470472,0.4840785,0.4950712,0.49112818,0.5070823,0.54961383,0.5274375,0.5373594,0.5295177,0.56478626,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

This approach is effective when using the large deformation viscous framework, where linear averaging is not valid, or in the elastic case. The theory behind this novel atlas building algorithm is similar to the traditional pairwise registration problem, but with single image forces replaced by average forces. These group forces drive an average transport ordinary differential equation allowing one to estimate the geodesic that moves an image toward the mean shape configuration. This model gives large deformation atlases that are optimal with respect to the shape manifold as defined by the data and the image registration assumptions. We use the techniques in the large deformation context here, but they also pertain to small deformation atlas construction. Furthermore, a natural, inherently inverse consistent image registration is gained for free, as is a tool for constant arc length geodesic shape interpolation. The geodesic atlas creation algorithm is quantitatively compared to the Euclidean anatomical average to elucidate the need for optimized atlases.

The aim of this paper is to test whether both whole genome SNP data and whole brain imaging data offer predictive values to identify subjects at risk for progressing to AD. In 343 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1), we extracted high dimensional MR imaging (volumetric data on 93 brain regions plus a surface fluid registration based hippocampal subregion and surface data), and whole genome data (504,095 SNPs from GWAS), as well as routine neurocognitive and clinical data at baseline. MCI patients were then followed over 48 months, with 150 participants progressing to AD.

Generally, feature selection methods are preferable in clinical applications due to their ease for interpretation, but subspace learning methods can usually achieve more promising results. In this paper, we combine two different methodological approaches to discriminative feature selection in a unified framework. Specifically, we utilize two subspace learning methods, namely, linear discriminant analysis and locality preserving projection, which have proven their effectiveness in a variety of fields, to select class-discriminative and noise-resistant features.

Most existing classification methods extract features from neuroimaging data and then construct a single classifier to perform classification. However, due to noise and small sample size of neuroimaging data, it is challenging to train only a global classifier that can be robust enough to achieve good classification performance. In this paper, instead of building a single global classifier, we propose a local patch-based subspace ensemble method which builds multiple individual classifiers based on different subsets of local patches and then combines them for more accurate and robust classification. Specifically, to capture the local spatial consistency, each brain image is partitioned into a number of local patches and a subset of patches is randomly selected from the patch pool to build a weak classifier. Here, the sparse representation-based classifier (SRC) method, which has shown to be effective for classification of image data (e.g., face), is used to construct each weak classifier. Then, multiple weak classifiers are combined to make the final decision. We evaluate our method on 652 subjects (including 198 AD patients, 225 MCI and 229 normal controls) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using MR images.

The results were previously evaluated by comparison with manual segmentation on data from the 16 young healthy controls, with a leave-one-out strategy, and eight patients with AD.

Analysis on functional brain networks provides powerful abilities to discover potential mechanisms of human brain, and to aid brain disease detection, such as AD (Alzheimer’s disease). Effective discrimination of patients of AD and MCI (mild cognitive impairment) from NC (normal control) is important for the early diagnosis of AD. Therefore, this paper explores the problem of brain network classification for AD detection. Two deep learning methods of functional brain network classification are designed. The convolutional learning method learns the deep regional-connectivity features, while the recurrent learning method learns the deep adjacent positional features. The ELM (extreme learning machine)-boosted structure is also implemented to further improve the learning ability. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare the AUC (area under curve), accuracy, recall, and training time of the proposed methods on a real-world dataset. Results indicate that (1) the proposed methods which learn deep features directly from brain networks outperform shallow learning methods and (2) models with the ELM-boosted structure achieve a higher performance.

Support vector machine (SVM) as a high-dimensional pattern classification technique is widely employed in neuroimaging research. However, the application of a single SVM classifier may be difficult to achieve the excellent classification performance because of the small-sample size and noise of imaging data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method of the weighted random support vector machine cluster (WRSVMC) in which multiple SVMs were built and different weights were given to corresponding SVMs with different classification performances. We evaluated our algorithm on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) data of 93 MCI patients and 105 healthy controls (HC) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.

Recently, the combination of different types of features has been actively used in the area of the AD classification. In this paper, we proposed a novel classification framework to jointly select features, which are extracted from the VBM analysis and texture analysis to distinguish between the AD and the NC. Furthermore, in order to capture robust discriminative features, we improve the feature subset selection by combining the SVM-RFE and covariance to take into account the relationship among features. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we have performed evaluations on the MRI acquiring from the ADNI database.

Slow progress has been made in unifying different healthcare systems, and much of the globe still lacks a fully integrated healthcare system. As a result, it is critical and advantageous for healthcare providers to comprehend the fundamental ideas of AI in order to design and deliver their own AI-powered technology. AI is commonly defined as the capacity of machines to mimic human cognitive functions. It can tackle jobs with equivalent or superior performance to humans by combining computer science, algorithms, machine learning, and data science. The healthcare system is a dynamic and evolving environment, and medical experts are constantly confronted with new issues, shifting duties, and frequent interruptions. Because of this variation, illness diagnosis frequently becomes a secondary concern for healthcare professionals. Furthermore, clinical interpretation of medical information is a cognitively demanding endeavor. This applies not just to seasoned experts, but also to individuals with varying or limited skills, such as young assistant doctors. In this paper, we proposed the comparative analysis of various state-of-The-Art methods of deep learning for medical imaging diagnosis and evaluated various important characteristics.

No single marker has been proven to accurately categorize patients into their respective diagnostic groups. Thus, previous studies have attempted to develop fused predictors of AD and MCI. These studies have two main limitations. Most do not simultaneously consider all diagnostic categories and provide suboptimal fused representations using the same set of modalities for prediction of all classes. In this work, we present a combined framework, cascaded multiview canonical correlation (CaMCCo), for fusion and cascaded classification that incorporates all diagnostic categories and optimizes classification by selectively combining a subset of modalities at each level of the cascade. CaMCCo is evaluated on a data cohort comprising 149 patients for whom neurophysiological, neuroimaging, proteomic and genomic data were available. Results suggest that fusion of select modalities for each classification task outperforms (mean AUC = 0.92) fusion of all modalities (mean AUC = 0.54) and individual modalities (mean AUC = 0.90, 0.53, 0.71, 0.73, 0.62, 0.68).

Identifying those MCIs who are most likely to decline during a trial and thus most likely to benefit from treatment will improve trial efficiency and power to detect treatment effects.

In this paper, a multistage classifier using machine learning, including Naive Bayes classifier, support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), was used to classify Alzheimer's disease more acceptably and efficiently. For this, MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) scans were processed by FreeSurfer, a powerful software tool suitable for processing and normalizing brain MRI images. We also applied a feature selection technique - PSO (particle swarm optimization) to many feature vectors in order to obtain the best features that represent the salient characteristics of AD. The results of the proposed method outperform individual techniques in a benchmark database provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Institute (ADNI).",0.5336781,0.5358385,0.5685585,0.52993137,0.5403247,0.5546164,0.5024638,0.5016511,0.5459703,0.59046775,0.55507207,0.5243557,0.5502138,0.62799186,Multistage classifier-based approach for Alzheimer's disease prediction and retrieval,1/1/2019,,K.

However, it is very challenging to effectively integrate such rich features, since straightforward concatenation or singleview spectral embedding methods rarely leads to physically meaningful integration. In this paper, we present a supervised multi-view/multi-modal spectral embedding method (SMSE) for neuroimaging classification. This method embeds the high dimensional multi-view features derived from multi-modal neuroimaging data into a low dimensional feature space and preserves the optimal local embeddings among different views. The proposed SMSE algorithm, validated using three groups of neuroimaging data, is able to achieve significant classification improvement over the state-of-the-art multi-view spectral embedding methods. © 2013 IEEE.",0.44620898,0.5025462,0.5236452,0.52482474,0.403607,0.3065463,0.35331038,0.36195007,0.41101182,0.44919154,0.41215792,0.4226439,0.39509732,0.47807544,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

This paper reviews the studies of methods and biomarkers for predicting AD progression based on multimodal MRI. First, different approaches for predicting AD progression are analyzed and summarized, including machine learning, deep learning, regression, and other MRI analysis methods. Then, the effective biomarkers of AD progression under structural magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and arterial spin labeling modes of MRI are summarized. It is believed that the brain changes shown on MRI may be related to the cognitive decline in different prodrome stages of AD, which is conducive to the further realization of early intervention and prevention of AD. Finally, the deficiencies of the existing studies are analyzed in terms of data set size, data heterogeneity, processing methods, and research depth. More importantly, future research directions are proposed, including enriching data sets, simplifying biomarkers, utilizing multimodal magnetic resonance, etc. In the future, the study of AD progression by multimodal MRI will still be a challenge but also a significant research hotspot.",0.45983958,0.54089785,0.55151284,0.6240757,0.45004725,0.45827553,0.41129038,0.39724356,0.44929594,0.474573,0.48743665,0.4989323,0.464377,0.46893,Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Progression Based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging,11/17/2021,,Ying Zhou; Zeyu Song; Xiao Han; Hanjun Li; Xiaoying Tang,ACS Chemical Neuroscience,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119063813&origin=inward,,,,4209-4223,2021,"@article{,

Distinctive and reliable biomarkers of AD are now available through structural MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid β or tau proteins.

The progressive nature of AD causes the brain cell deterioration that eventfully leads to physical dependency and mental disability which hinders a person’s normal life. A computer-aided diagnostic system is required that can aid physicians in diagnosing AD in real-time. The AD stages classification remains an important research area. To extract the deep-features, the traditional machine learning-based and deep learning-based methods often require large dataset and that leads to class imbalance and overfitting issues. To overcome this problem, the use an efficient transfer learning architecture to extract deep features which are further used for AD stage classification. In this study, an Alzheimer’s stage detection system is proposed based on deep features using a pre-trained AlexNet model, by transferring the initial layers from pre-trained AlexNet model and extract the deep features from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of spatial patterns of regional brain atrophy found to be characteristic of AD and FTD were determined via cross-validation and via split-sample methods. Complex spatial patterns of relatively reduced brain volumes were identified, including temporal, orbitofrontal, parietal and cingulate regions, which were predominantly characteristic of either AD or FTD. These patterns provided 100% diagnostic accuracy, when used to separate AD or FTD from healthy controls. The ability to correctly distinguish AD from FTD averaged 84.3%.

The fully connected layers of two convolutional neural networks based on CaffeNet and VGGNet, previously trained on the 2012 Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge data set, were retrained on the training set. Weights in the convolutional layers of each network were frozen to serve as fixed feature extractors. Accuracy on the test set was evaluated for each network.

We studied 46 individuals who had both antemortem MRI and an autopsy. Subjects were clinicopathologically classified as having Alzheimer's disease (n = 11), DLB (n = 23) or VCI (n = 12). MTA was rated visually using a standardized (Scheltens) scale blind to clinical or autopsy diagnosis. Neuropathological analysis included Braak staging as well as quantitative analysis of plaques, tangles and α-synuclein Lewy body-associated pathology in the hippocampus. Correlations between MTA and pathological measures were carried out using Spearman's rho, linear regression to assess the contributions of local pathologic changes to MTA. Receiver operator curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic specificity of MTA for Alzheimer's disease among individuals with Alzheimer's disease, DLB and VCI. MTA was a highly accurate diagnostic marker for autopsy confirmed Alzheimer's disease (sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 94%) compared with DLB and VCI. Across the entire sample, correlations were observed between MTA and Braak stage (ρ = 0.50, P < 0.001), per cent area of plaques in the hippocampus (ρ = 0.37, P = 0.014) and per cent area of tangles in the hippocampus (ρ = 0.49, P = 0.001). Linear regression showed Braak stage (P = 0.022) to be a significant predictor of MTA but not percent area of plaques (P = 0.375), percent area of tangles (P = 0.330) or percent area of Lewy bodies (P = 0.086). MTA on MRI had robust discriminatory power for distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from DLB and VCI in pathologically confirmed cases. Pathologically, it is more strongly related to tangle rather than plaque or Lewy body pathology in the temporal lobe. It may have utility as a means for stratifying samples in vivo on the basis of putative differences in pathology. © The Author (2008).

For instance, the personalized diagnosis and treatment planning for a single cancer patient relies on various images (e.g. radiology, pathology and camera images) and non-image data (e.g. clinical data and genomic data). However, such decision-making procedures can be subjective, qualitative, and have large inter-subject variabilities. With the recent advances in multimodal deep learning technologies, an increasingly large number of efforts have been devoted to a key question: how do we extract and aggregate multimodal information to ultimately provide more objective, quantitative computer-aided clinical decision making? This paper reviews the recent studies on dealing with such a question. Briefly, this review will include the (a) overview of current multimodal learning workflows, (b) summarization of multimodal fusion methods, (c) discussion of the performance, (d) applications in disease diagnosis and prognosis, and (e) challenges and future directions.",0.39047927,0.50529337,0.5034644,0.6244906,0.41424072,0.492168,0.3730175,0.36347532,0.36483276,0.44320747,0.4517255,0.47768602,0.41614893,0.42494112,Deep multimodal fusion of image and non-image data in disease diagnosis and prognosis: a review,4/1/2023,,Can Cui; Haichun Yang; Yaohong Wang; Shilin Zhao; Zuhayr Asad; Lori A.

Use of FS is highly relevant in neuroimaging-based machine learning, as the number of attributes can greatly exceed the number of exemplars.We strongly endorse their demonstration of both of these findings, andwe provide additional important practical and theoretical arguments as towhy, in their case, the data-driven FS methods they implemented did not result in improved accuracy. Further, we emphasize that the data-driven FS methods they tested performed approximately as well as the all-voxel case.

The system permits the evaluation of the volumes of grey matter in subjects such as the AD or the conditions related to it and are compared in an automated manner with the healthy controls in the entire brain. The article also reviews the findings of the VBM that are related to various stages of the AD and also its prodrome known as the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). For this work, the Ada Boost classifier has been proposed to be a good selector of feature that brings down the classification error’s upper bound. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) had been employed for the dimensionality reduction and for improving efficiency. The PCA is a powerful, as well as a reliable, tool in data analysis. Calculating fitness scores will be an independent process. For this reason, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) along with a greedy search may be computed easily along with some high-performance systems of computing. The primary goal of this work was to identify better collections or permutations of the classifiers that are weak to build stronger ones.

This study aimed to assess the improvement in classification accuracy that can be achieved by combining features from different structural MRI analysis techniques. Automatically estimated MR features used are hippocampal volume, tensor-based morphometry, cortical thickness and a novel technique based on manifold learning. Baseline MRIs acquired from all 834 subjects (231 healthy controls (HC), 238 stable mild cognitive impairment (S-MCI), 167 MCI to AD progressors (P-MCI), 198 AD) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were used for evaluation. We compared the classification accuracy achieved with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM). The best results achieved with individual features are 90% sensitivity and 84% specificity (HC/AD classification), 64%/66% (S-MCI/P-MCI) and 82%/76% (HC/P-MCI) with the LDA classifier. The combination of all features improved these results to 93% sensitivity and 85% specificity (HC/AD), 67%/69% (S-MCI/P-MCI) and 86%/82% (HC/P-MCI). Compared with previously published results in the ADNI database using individual MR-based features, the presented results show that a comprehensive analysis of MRI images combining multiple features improves classification accuracy and predictive power in detecting early AD. The most stable and reliable classification was achieved when combining all available features. © 2011 Wolz et al.",0.57018244,0.6306311,0.65360504,0.62756187,0.5589492,0.44184887,0.51055974,0.5066274,0.5913173,0.5888099,0.5829879,0.5684303,0.5805817,0.634653,Multi-method analysis of MRI images in early diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease,10/13/2011,,Robin Wolz; Valtteri Julkunen; Juha Koikkalainen; Eini Niskanen; Dong Ping Zhang; Daniel Rueckert; Hilkka Soininen; Jyrki Lötjönen,PLoS ONE,246,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80054077865&origin=inward,,,,,2011,"@article{,

In the isointense stage (approximately 6-8 months of age), WM and GM exhibit similar levels of intensity in both T1 and T2 MR images, making the tissue segmentation very challenging. Only a small number of existing methods have been designed for tissue segmentation in this isointense stage; however, they only used a single T1 or T2 images, or the combination of T1 and T2 images. In this paper, we propose to use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmenting isointense stage brain tissues using multi-modality MR images. CNNs are a type of deep models in which trainable filters and local neighborhood pooling operations are applied alternatingly on the raw input images, resulting in a hierarchy of increasingly complex features. Specifically, we used multi-modality information from T1, T2, and fractional anisotropy (FA) images as inputs and then generated the segmentation maps as outputs. The multiple intermediate layers applied convolution, pooling, normalization, and other operations to capture the highly nonlinear mappings between inputs and outputs. We compared the performance of our approach with that of the commonly used segmentation methods on a set of manually segmented isointense stage brain images. Results showed that our proposed model significantly outperformed prior methods on infant brain tissue segmentation. In addition, our results indicated that integration of multi-modality images led to significant performance improvement.",0.41972488,0.46084255,0.47160342,0.49410403,0.4091518,0.36599416,0.3748466,0.37018555,0.3807054,0.48541126,0.4502734,0.45192605,0.5002286,0.5022489,Deep convolutional neural networks for multi-modality isointense infant brain image segmentation,3/1/2015,,Wenlu Zhang; Rongjian Li; Houtao Deng; Li Wang; Weili Lin; Shuiwang Ji; Dinggang Shen,NeuroImage,670,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84921492033&origin=inward,,,,214-224,2015,"@article{,

We aimed to investigate if the combination of baseline MRI and CSF could enhance the classification of AD compared to using either alone and predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion at multiple future time points. 369 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included in the study (AD=96, MCI=162 and CTL=111). Freesurfer was used to generate regional subcortical volumes and cortical thickness measures. A total of 60 variables were used for orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS) multivariate analysis (57 MRI measures and 3 CSF measures: Aβ 42, t-tau and p-tau). Combining MRI and CSF gave the best results for distinguishing AD vs. CTL. We found an accuracy of 91.8% for the combined model at baseline compared to 81.6% for CSF measures and 87.0% for MRI measures alone. The combined model also gave the best accuracy when distinguishing between MCI vs. CTL (77.6%) at baseline. MCI subjects who converted to AD by 12 and 18month follow-up were accurately predicted at baseline using an AD vs. CTL model (82.9% and 86.4% respectively), with lower prediction accuracies for those MCI subjects converting by 24 and 36month follow up (75.4% and 68.0% respectively). The overall prediction accuracies for converters and non-converters ranged from 58.6% to 66.4% at different time points. Combining MRI and CSF measures in a multivariate model at baseline gave better accuracy for discriminating between AD and CTL, between MCI and CTL and for predicting future conversion from MCI to AD, than using either MRI or CSF separately. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0.53481084,0.5880205,0.6360799,0.65730584,0.5189171,0.48178393,0.48240945,0.47658038,0.5589896,0.5566104,0.5407732,0.5020605,0.5618798,0.5772949,Combining MRI and CSF measures for classification of Alzheimer's disease and prediction of mild cognitive impairment conversion,8/1/2012,,Eric Westman; J.

The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), an advanced imaging technique, is capable of producing high quality images of the human body including the brain for diagnosis purposes. This paper proposes a simple but efficient solution for the classification of MRI brain images into normal, and abnormal images containing disorders and injuries. It uses images with brain tumor, acute stroke and alzheimer, besides normal images, from the public dataset developed by harvard medical school, for evaluation purposes. The proposed model is a four step process, in which the steps are named: 1). Pre-processing, 2). Features Extraction, 3). Features Reduction, and 4). Classification. Median filter, being one of the best algorithms, is used for the removal of noise such as salt and pepper, and unwanted components such as scalp and skull, in the pre-processing step. During this stage, the images are converted from gray scale to colored images for further processing. In second step, it uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique to extract different features from the images. In third stage, Color Moments (CMs) are used to reduce the number of features and get an optimal set of characteristics. Images with the optimal set of features are passed to different classifiers for the classification of images. The Feed Forward - ANN (FF-ANN), an individual classifier, which was given a 65% to 35% split ratio for training and testing, and hybrid classifiers called: Random Subspace with Random Forest (RSwithRF) and Random Subspace with Bayesian Network (RSwithBN), which used 10-Fold cross validation technique, resulted in 95.83%, 97.14% and 95.71% accurate classification, in corresponding order.

Brain parcellation-based computer-aided methods for detecting AD and MCI segregate the brain in different anatomical regions and use their features to predict AD and MCI. Brain parcellation generally is carried out based on existing anatomical atlas templates, which vary in the boundaries and number of anatomical regions. This works considers dividing the brain based on different atlases and combining the features extracted from these anatomical parcellations for a more holistic and robust representation. We collected data from the ADNI database and divided brains based on two well-known atlases: LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40) and Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL). We used baselines images of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to calculate average gray-matter density and average relative cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in each region. Later, we classified AD, MCI and cognitively normal (CN) subjects using the individual features extracted from each atlas template and the combined features of both atlases. We reduced the dimensionality of individual and combined features using principal component analysis, and used support vector machines for classification. We also ranked features mostly involved in classification to determine the importance of brain regions for accurately classifying the subjects.

In the literature, several image processing techniques, as well as machine learning strategies, were introduced for the diagnosis of the disease. This study is aimed at recognizing the presence of Alzheimer's disease based on the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and various machine learning (ML) and image processing methods have been used to detect it. In this study, we used ML methods to classify AD using image and gene expression data. First, SpinalNet and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to classify AD from MRI images. Then we used microarray gene expression data to classify the diseases using k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector classifier (SVC), and Xboost classifiers. Previous approaches used only either images or gene expression, while we used both data together and also explained the results using trustworthy methods. it was difficult to understand how the classifiers predicted the diseases and genes. It would be useful if the results of these classifiers could be explained in a trustworthy way. To establish trustworthy predictive modeling, we introduced an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method. The XAI approach we used here is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) for a simple human interpretation. LIME interprets how genes were predicted and which genes are particularly responsible for an AD patient. The accuracy of CNN is 97.6%, which is 10.96% higher than the SpinlNet approach.

To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model that scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique that shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images. © 2011 ACM.",0.32853857,0.3395348,0.35253754,0.2913439,0.39467245,0.30664435,0.32146743,0.32763168,0.30606002,0.42860493,0.38248828,0.37311116,0.43718433,0.44501278,Unsupervised learning of hierarchical representations with convolutional deep belief networks,10/1/2011,,Honglak Lee; Roger Grosse; Rajesh Ranganath; Andrew Y.

These methods promise fully automated, standard PC-based clinical decisions, unbiased by variable radiological expertise. We recently used support vector machines (SVMs) to separate sporadic Alzheimer's disease from normal ageing and from fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In this study, we compare the results to those obtained by radiologists. A binary diagnostic classification was made by six radiologists with different levels of experience on the same scans and information that had been previously analysed with SVM. SVMs correctly classified 95% (sensitivity/specificity: 95/95) of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and controls into their respective groups. Radiologists correctly classified 65-95% (median 89%; sensitivity/specificity: 88/90) of scans. SVM correctly classified another set of sporadic Alzheimer's disease in 93% (sensitivity/specificity: 100/86) of cases, whereas radiologists ranged between 80% and 90% (median 83%; sensitivity/specificity: 80/85). SVMs were better at separating patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease from those with FTLD (SVM 89%; sensitivity/specificity: 83/95; compared to radiological range from 63% to 83%; median 71%; sensitivity/specificity: 64/76). Radiologists were always accurate when they reported a high degree of diagnostic confidence. The results show that well-trained neuroradiologists classify typical Alzheimer's disease-associated scans comparable to SVMs. However, SVMs require no expert knowledge and trained SVMs can readily be exchanged between centres for use in diagnostic classification. These results are encouraging and indicate a role for computerized diagnostic methods in clinical practice. © 2008 The Author(s).",0.54797846,0.5757115,0.5652638,0.5562752,0.5431112,0.5211948,0.5001892,0.49723268,0.54854107,0.5499917,0.5504058,0.5105126,0.5220066,0.62819713,Accuracy of dementia diagnosis - A direct comparison between radiologists and a computerized method,11/1/2008,,Stefan Klöppel; Cynthia M.

As AD is inherently dynamic, it is also not clear how the relationships among AD indicators vary over time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid computational approach for AD classification and evaluate it on the heterogeneous longitudinal AIBL dataset. Specifically, using clinical dementia rating as an index of AD severity, the most important indicators (mini-mental state examination, logical memory recall, grey matter and cerebrospinal volumes from MRI and active voxels from PiB-PET brain scans, ApoE, and age) can be automatically identified from parallel data mining algorithms. In this work, Bayesian network modelling across different time points is used to identify and visualize time-varying relationships among the significant features, and importantly, in an efficient way using only coarse-grained data. Crucially, our approach suggests key data features and their appropriate combinations that are relevant for AD severity classification with high accuracy.

Recently several authors investigated how clinical trials for AD can be made more efficient (i.e., smaller sample size) using predictive measures from such classification methods. In this paper, we explain why predictive measures given by such SVM type objectives may be less than ideal for use in the setting described above. We give a solution based on a novel deep learning model, randomized denoising autoencoders (rDA), which regresses on training labels y while also accounting for the variance, a property which is very useful for clinical trial design. Our results give strong improvements in sample size estimates over strategies based on multi-kernel learning. Also, rDA predictions appear to more accurately correlate to stages of disease. Separately, our formulation empirically shows how deep architectures can be applied in the large d, small n regime - the default situation in medical imaging.

We assessed patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or semantic dementia (SD) on a visual oddity judgment task that did not place an explicit demand on long-term memory and is known to be sensitive to hippocampal and perirhinal cortex lesions. Importantly, within the medial temporal lobe, AD is associated with predominant hippocampal atrophy, whereas SD patients have greater perirhinal cortex damage. The AD group was selectively impaired in oddity judgment for scenes, whereas the SD patients demonstrated a deficit in face oddity judgment only. This compelling double dissociation supports the idea that the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex may be critical for the processing of scenes and objects, respectively, in the domain of perception or very short-term working memory.

The definition of new approaches for the design of proper clinical trials is highly demanded in order to achieve non-confounding results and assess more effective treatment. In this study, a cohort of 200 subjects was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Subjects were followed-up for 24 months, and classified as AD (50), progressive-MCI to AD (50), stable-MCI (50), and cognitively normal (50). Structural T1-weighted MRI brain studies and neuropsychological measures of these subjects were used to train and optimize an artificial-intelligence classifier to distinguish mild-AD patients who need treatment (AD + pMCI) from subjects who do not need treatment (sMCI + CN). The classifier was able to distinguish between the two groups 24 months before AD definite diagnosis using a combination of MRI brain studies and specific neuropsychological measures, with 85% accuracy, 83% sensitivity, and 87% specificity. The combined-approach model outperformed the classification using MRI data alone (72% classification accuracy, 69% sensitivity, and 75% specificity).

The state-of-the-art techniques that consider multimodal diagnosis have been shown to have accuracy better than a manual diagnosis. However, collecting data from different modalities is time-consuming and expensive, and some modalities may have radioactive side effects. Our study is confined to structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). The objectives of our attempt are as follows: 1) to increase the accuracy level that is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods; 2) to overcome the overfitting problem, and; 3) to analyze proven landmarks of the brain that provide discernible features for AD diagnosis. Here, we focused specifically on both the left and right hippocampus areas. To achieve the objectives, at first, we incorporate ensembles of simple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractors and softmax cross-entropy as the classifier. Then, considering the scarcity of data, we deployed a patch-based approach. We have performed our experiment on the Gwangju Alzheimer's and Related Dementia (GARD) cohort dataset prepared by the National Research Center for Dementia (GARD), Gwangju, South Korea. We manually localized the left and right hippocampus and fed three view patches (TVPs) to the CNN after the preprocessing steps. We achieve 90.05% accuracy.

Conventional approaches extract cortical morphological information, such as regional mean cortical thickness and regional cortical volumes, independently at different regions of interest (ROIs) without considering the relationship between these regions. Our approach involves constructing a similarity map where every element in the map represents the correlation of regional mean cortical thickness between a pair of ROIs. We will demonstrate in this article that this correlative morphological information gives significant improvement in classification performance when compared with ROI-based morphological information. Classification performance is further improved by integrating the correlative information with ROI-based information via multi-kernel support vector machines. This integrated framework achieves an accuracy of 92.35% for AD classification with an area of 0.9744 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and an accuracy of 83.75% for MCI classification with an area of 0.9233. In differentiating MCI subjects who converted to AD within 36 months from non-converters, an accuracy of 75.05% with an area of 0.8426 under ROC curve was achieved, indicating excellent diagnostic power and generalizability.

Existing AD detection methods rely on global feature learning from the whole brain scans, while depending on the tissue types, AD related features in different tissue regions, e.g. grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), show different characteristics. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for multi-scale feature learning based on segmented tissue areas. A novel deep 3D multi-scale convolutional network scheme is proposed to generate multi-resolution features for AD detection. The proposed scheme employs several parallel 3D multi-scale convolutional networks, each applying to individual tissue regions (GM, WM and CSF) followed by feature fusions. The proposed fusion is applied in two separate levels: the first level fusion is applied on different scales within the same tissue region, and the second level is on different tissue regions. To further reduce the dimensions of features and mitigate overfitting, a feature boosting and dimension reduction method, XGBoost, is utilized before the classification. The proposed deep learning scheme has been tested on a moderate open dataset of ADNI (1198 scans from 337 subjects), with excellent test performance on randomly partitioned datasets (best 99.67%, average 98.29%), and good test performance on subject-separated partitioned datasets (best 94.74%, average 89.51%).

This directional distance measure arises in several applications, including document classification and human brain imaging. Using ideas from the field of constrained low-rank matrix factorization and sparse approximation, a novel approach is presented that differs from classical clustering methods, such as seminonnegative matrix factorization, K-EVD, or k-means clustering, yet combines some aspects of all these. As in nonnegative matrix factorization and K-EVD, the matrix decomposition is iteratively refined to optimize a data fidelity term; however, no positivity constraint is enforced directly nor do we need to explicitly compute eigenvectors. As in k-means and K-EVD, each optimization step is followed by a hard cluster assignment. This leads to an efficient algorithm that is shown here to outperform common competitors in terms of clustering performance and/or computation speed. In addition to a detailed theoretical analysis of some of the algorithm's main properties, the approach is empirically evaluated on a range of toy problems, several standard text clustering data sets, and a high-dimensional problem in brain imaging, where functional magnetic resonance imaging data are used to partition the human cerebral cortex into distinct functional regions.",0.25752956,0.2992566,0.24438003,0.23575468,0.2161977,0.23860717,0.23138256,0.21487838,0.27635115,0.24317278,0.26739675,0.25915447,0.24468899,0.33593237,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

In addition, the method was evaluated by participation in the Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Dementia (CADDementia) challenge. Cross-validation using ADNI and AIBL data resulted in a multi-class classification accuracy of 62.7% for the discrimination of healthy normal controls (NC), subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This performance generalized to the CADDementia challenge where the method, trained using the ADNI and AIBL data, achieved a classification accuracy 63.0%. The obtained classification accuracy resulted in a first place in the challenge, and the method was significantly better (McNemar's test) than the bottom 24 methods out of the total of 29 methods contributed by 15 different teams in the challenge.

This is achieved by optimizing an energy function that requires each point to have its best-scale geometric features consistent over the corresponding points in the training samples, and at the same time distinctive from those of nearby points in the neighborhood. Second, the active points used to drive the brain registration are hierarchically selected during the registration procedure, based on their saliency and consistency measures. That is, the image points with salient and consistent features (across different individuals) are considered for the initial registration of two images, while other less salient and consistent points join the registration procedure later. By incorporating these two novel strategies into the framework of the HAMMER registration algorithm, the registration accuracy has been improved according to the results on simulated brain data, and also visible improvement is observed particularly in the cortical regions of real brain data. © 2006 IEEE.",0.3651159,0.43358454,0.37692136,0.35801485,0.3632796,0.27672914,0.35053343,0.34569946,0.3404183,0.36198023,0.3509463,0.35280278,0.33803585,0.47289944,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

A morphological representation of the anatomy of interest is first obtained using a high-dimensional mass-preserving template warping method, which results in tissue density maps that constitute local tissue volumetric measurements. Regions that display strong correlations between tissue volume and classification (clinical) variables are extracted using a watershed segmentation algorithm, taking into account the regional smoothness of the correlation map which is estimated by a cross-validation strategy to achieve robustness to outliers. A volume increment algorithm is then applied to these regions to extract regional volumetric features, from which a feature selection technique using support vector machine (SVM)-based criteria is used to select the most discriminative features, according to their effect on the upper bound of the leave-one-out generalization error. Finally, SVM-based classification is applied using the best set of features, and it is tested using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The results on MR brain images of healthy controls and schizophrenia patients demonstrate not only high classification accuracy (91.8% for female subjects and 90.8% for male subjects), but also good stability with respect to the number of features selected and the size of SVM kernel used. © 2006 IEEE.",0.47463077,0.5232304,0.49118593,0.43515778,0.43883118,0.33891356,0.4151549,0.41798458,0.46372488,0.486382,0.4531,0.43835813,0.4515599,0.58683664,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

The geometric feature is derived from the structural geometry of diffusion and characterizes the shape of the tensor in terms of prolateness, oblateness, and sphericity of the tensor. Local spatial distributions of the prolate, oblate, and spherical geometry are used to create an attribute vector of geometric feature for matching. The orientation feature improves the matching of the WM fiber tracts by taking into account the statistical information of underlying fiber orientations. These features are incorporated into a hierarchical deformable registration framework to develop a diffusion tensor image registration algorithm. Extensive experiments on simulated and real brain DT data establish the superiority of this algorithm for deformable matching of diffusion tensors, thereby aiding in atlas creation. The robustness of the method makes it potentially useful for group-based analysis of DT images acquired in large studies to identify disease-induced and developmental changes. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",0.31001627,0.36343923,0.3234482,0.309375,0.29266223,0.23249404,0.2831992,0.2684248,0.29675108,0.2986678,0.3093285,0.30818304,0.26791552,0.36938635,Diffusion tensor image registration using tensor geometry and orientation features,1/1/2008,,Jinzhong Yang; Dinggang Shen; Christos Davatzikos; Ragini Verma,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),69,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84883846045&origin=inward,,,,905-913,2008,"@article{,

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters.

This is particularly interesting and important because the decision region generated by the method will be unaffected by the position of the outliers and the form of the data will fit more precisely.

The conventional statistical shape model methods, such as the active shape model (ASM), have been very successful in modeling shape variability. However, their accuracy and effectiveness typically drop dramatically in high-dimensionality problems involving relatively small training datasets, which is customary in 3D and 4D medical imaging applications. The proposed statistical model of deformation (SMD) uses wavelet-based decompositions coupled with PCA in each wavelet band, in order to more accurately estimate the pdf of high-dimensional deformation fields, when a relatively small number of training samples are available. SMD is further used as statistical prior to regularize the deformation field in an SMD-constrained deformable registration framework. As a result, more robust registration results are obtained relative to using generic smoothness constraints on deformation fields, such as Laplacian-based regularization. In experiments, we first illustrate the performance of SMD in representing the variability of deformation fields and then evaluate the performance of the SMD-constrained registration, via comparing a hierarchical volumetric image registration algorithm, HAMMER, with its SMD-constrained version, referred to as SMD+HAMMER.

1260,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0218-0014(00)00060-x,5.75E-05,1,0,"This paper proposes a general formalism for representation, inference and learning with general hybrid Bayesian networks in which continuous and discrete variables may appear anywhere in a directed acyclic graph. The formalism fuzzifies a hybrid Bayesian network into two alternative forms: the first form replaces each continuous variable in the given directed acyclic graph (DAG) by a partner discrete variable and adds a directed link from the partner discrete variable to the continuous one. The mapping between two variables is not crisp quantization but is approximated (fuzzified) by a conditional Gaussian (CG) distribution. The CG model is equivalent to a fuzzy set but no fuzzy logic formalism is employed. The conditional distribution of a discrete variable given its discrete parents is still assumed to be multinomial as in discrete Bayesian networks. The second form only replaces each continuous variable whose descendants include discrete variables by a partner discrete variable and adds a directed link from that partner discrete variable to the continuous one. The dependence between the partner discrete variable and the original continuous variable is approximated by a CG distribution, but the dependence between a continuous variable and its continuous and discrete parents is approximated by a conditional Gaussian regression (CGR) distribution. Obviously, the second form is a finer approximation, but restricted to CGR models, and requires more complicated inference and learning algorithms. This results in two general approximate representations of a general hybrid Bayesian networks, which are called here the fuzzy Bayesian network (FBN) form-I and form-II. For the two forms of FBN, general exact inference algorithms exists, which are extensions of the junction tree inference algorithm for discrete Bayesian networks. Learning fuzzy Bayesian networks from data is different from learning purely discrete Bayesian networks because not only all the newly converted discrete variables are latent in the data, but also the number of discrete states for each of these variables and the CG or CGR distribution of each continuous variable given its partner discrete parents or both continuous and discrete parents have to be determined.",0.23271486,0.28210682,0.28991807,0.22256733,0.19525248,0.20051336,0.2171769,0.2061388,0.2317572,0.2298832,0.22431117,0.2213905,0.23906709,0.24991101,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

The decisional space is constructed using those features deemed statistically significant through an elaborate feature selection and ranking mechanism. FreeSurfer was used to calculate 55 volumetric variables, which were then adjusted for intracranial volume, age and education. The classification results obtained using support vector machines are based on twofold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs. The study included 59 AD, 67 aMCI, 56 naMCI, and 127 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. The study shows that MMSE scores contain the most discriminative power of AD, aMCI, and naMCI. For AD versus CN, the two most discriminative volumetric variables (right hippocampus and left inferior lateral ventricle), when combined with MMSE scores, provided an average accuracy of 92.4% (sensitivity: 84.0%; specificity: 96.1%). MMSE scores are found to improve all classifications with accuracy increments of 8.2% and 12% for aMCI versus CN and naMCI versus CN, respectively. Results also show that brain atrophy is almost evenly seen on both sides of the brain for AD subjects, which is different from right-side dominance for aMCI and left-side dominance for naMCI. Furthermore, hippocampal atrophy is seen to be the most significant for aMCI, while Accumbens area and ventricle are most significant for naMCI. © 1964-2012 IEEE.",0.51946455,0.5407078,0.5674755,0.5740338,0.50442064,0.45539123,0.47130248,0.46371597,0.5555941,0.5281419,0.5290578,0.51065576,0.53739107,0.5873134,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found
2096,https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.20009,3.91E-05,1,0,"This report describes the first human study of a novel amyloid-imaging positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, termed Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB), in 16 patients with diagnosed mild AD and 9 controls. Compared with controls, AD patients typically showed marked retention of PIB in areas of association cortex known to contain large amounts of amyloid deposits in AD. In the AD patient group, PIB retention was increased most prominently in frontal cortex (1.94-fold, p = 0.0001). Large increases also were observed in parietal (1.71-fold, p = 0.0002), temporal (1.52-fold, p = 0.002), and occipital (1.54-fold, p = 0.002) cortex and the striatum (1.76-fold, p = 0.0001). PIB retention was equivalent in AD patients and controls in areas known to be relatively unaffected by amyloid deposition (such as subcortical white matter, pons, and cerebellum). Studies in three young (21 years) and six older healthy controls (69.5 ± 11 years) showed low PIB retention in cortical areas and no significant group differences between young and older controls. In cortical areas, PIB retention correlated inversely with cerebral glucose metabolism determined with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. This relationship was most robust in the parietal cortex (r = -0.72; p = 0.0001). The results suggest that PET imaging with the novel tracer, PIB, can provide quantitative information on amyloid deposits in living subjects.",0.35849825,0.37213996,0.35789517,0.45453125,0.38900813,0.3513914,0.3579565,0.338907,0.4017283,0.34100333,0.36648595,0.3310037,0.34289864,0.3752785,Imaging Brain Amyloid in Alzheimer's Disease with Pittsburgh Compound-B,1/1/2004,,William E.

Topics addressed include incidence, prevalence, mortality rates, health expenditures and costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society. The report also explores issues that arise when people with AD and other dementias live alone. The characteristics, risks, and unmet needs of this population are described. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have AD, including approximately 200,000 age <65 years who comprise the younger-onset AD population. Over the coming decades, the aging of the baby boom generation is projected to result in an additional 10 million people with AD. Today, someone in America develops AD every 68 seconds. By 2050, there is expected to be one new case of AD every 33 seconds, or nearly a million new cases per year, and AD prevalence is projected to be 11 million to 16 million. Dramatic increases in the number of ""oldest-old"" (those age ≥85 years) across all racial and ethnic groups are expected to contribute to the increased prevalence of AD. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥65 years. Although the proportions of deaths due to other major causes of death have decreased in the last several years, the proportion due to AD has risen significantly. Between 2000 and 2008, the proportion of deaths due to heart disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased by 13%, 20%, and 8%, respectively, whereas the proportion due to AD increased by 66%. In 2011, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.4 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than 210 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. In 2012, payments for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are expected to be $200 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 800,000 people with AD (one in seven) live alone, and up to half of them do not have an identifiable caregiver. People with dementia who live alone are exposed to risks that exceed the risks encountered by people with dementia who live with others, including inadequate self-care, malnutrition, untreated medical conditions, falls, wandering from home unattended, and accidental deaths. © 2012 The Alzheimer's Association.

Participants (111 MCI, 73 normal cognition) underwent 3-T structural magnetic resonance imaging. The obtained images were assessed using voxel-based morphometry, including extraction of cerebral grey matter, analyses of statistical differences, and correlation analyses between cerebral grey matter and clinical cognitive scores in MCI. The CNN-based deep learning method was used to extract features of cerebral grey matter images. Compared to subjects with normal cognition, participants with MCI had grey matter atrophy mainly in the entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, and bilateral frontotemporal lobes (p < 0.0001). This atrophy was significantly correlated with the decline in cognitive scores (p < 0.01). The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the CNN model for identifying participants with MCI were 80.9%, 88.9%, and 75%, respectively. The area under the curve of the model was 0.891.

The current study integrates MRI and PET 15O water scans from 30 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, and tests the hypothesis that joint evaluation of structure and function can yield higher classification accuracy than either alone. Classification rates of up to 100% accuracy were achieved via leave-one-out cross-validation, whereas conservative estimates of generalization performance in new scans, evaluated via bagging cross-validation, yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve equal to 0.978 (97.8%), indicating excellent diagnostic accuracy. Spatial maps of regions determined to contribute the most to the classification implicated many temporal, prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and parietal regions.

Two distinct learning models (Model 1 and 2) are presented where both include subcortical area specific feature extraction, feature selection and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) deep neural network (DNN). The models learn highly complex and subtle differences in spatial atrophy patterns using white matter volumes, gray matter volumes, cortical surface area, cortical thickness, and different types of Fractal Brownian Motion co-occurrence matrices for texture as features to classify AD from cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in dementia patients. A five layer SAE with state-of-the-art dropout learning is trained on a publicly available ADNI dataset and the model performances are evaluated at two levels: one using in-house tenfold cross validation and another using the publicly available CADDementia competition. The in-house evaluations of our two models achieve 56.6% and 58.0% tenfold cross validation accuracies using 504 ADNI subjects. For the public domain evaluation, we are the first to report DNN to CADDementia and our methods yield competitive classification accuracies of 51.4% and 56.8%. Further, both of our proposed models offer higher True Positive Fraction (TPF) for AD class when compared to the top-overall ranked algorithm while Model 1 also ties for top diseased class sensitivity at 58.2% in the CADDementia challenge. Finally, Model 2 achieves strong disease class sensitivity with improvement in specificity and overall accuracy.

We used a conventional support vector machine (SVM) and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach based on structural MRI scans that underwent either minimal pre-processing or more extensive pre-processing into modulated gray matter (GM) maps. Classifiers were optimized and evaluated using cross-validation in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; 334 AD, 520 CN). Trained classifiers were subsequently applied to predict conversion to AD in ADNI MCI patients (231 converters, 628 non-converters) and in the independent Health-RI Parelsnoer Neurodegenerative Diseases Biobank data set. From this multi-center study representing a tertiary memory clinic population, we included 199 AD patients, 139 participants with subjective cognitive decline, 48 MCI patients converting to dementia, and 91 MCI patients who did not convert to dementia. AD-CN classification based on modulated GM maps resulted in a similar area-under-the-curve (AUC) for SVM (0.940; 95%CI: 0.924–0.955) and CNN (0.933; 95%CI: 0.918–0.948). Application to conversion prediction in MCI yielded significantly higher performance for SVM (AUC = 0.756; 95%CI: 0.720-0.788) than for CNN (AUC = 0.742; 95%CI: 0.709-0.776) (p<0.01 for McNemar's test). In external validation, performance was slightly decreased. For AD-CN, it again gave similar AUCs for SVM (0.896; 95%CI: 0.855–0.932) and CNN (0.876; 95%CI: 0.836–0.913). For prediction in MCI, performances decreased for both SVM (AUC = 0.665; 95%CI: 0.576-0.760) and CNN (AUC = 0.702; 95%CI: 0.624-0.786). Both with SVM and CNN, classification based on modulated GM maps significantly outperformed classification based on minimally processed images (p=0.01). Deep and conventional classifiers performed equally well for AD classification and their performance decreased only slightly when applied to the external cohort.

For this reason time series methods which assume regular sampling cannot be applied directly to the data without a pre-processing step. In this paper we use a random forest to learn the relationship between pairs of data points at different time separations. The input vector is a summary of the time series history and it includes both demographic and non-time varying variables such as genetic data. To test the method we use data from the TADPOLE grand challenge, an initiative which aims to predict the evolution of subjects at risk of Alzheimer’s disease using demographic, physical and cognitive input data. The task is to predict diagnosis, ADAS-13 score and normalised ventricles volume. While the competition proceeds, forecasting methods may be compared using a leaderboard dataset selected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and with standard metrics for measuring accuracy. For diagnosis, we find an mAUC of 0.82, and a classification accuracy of 0.73 compared with a benchmark SVM predictor which gives mAUC = 0.62 and BCA = 0.52.

2666,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1053-8119(02)00026-5,3.09E-05,1,0,"To accurately predict the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at its predementia stage would be a major breakthrough from both therapeutic and research standpoints. In this review, our focus is on markers obtained with structural imaging - especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - and on studies of subjects at risk of developing AD. Among the latter, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is currently the most commonly accepted reference, and therefore is specially targeted in this review. MCI refers to patients with significant but isolated memory impairment relative to subjects of identical age. Consistent with established histopathological data, structural imaging studies comparing patients with early probable AD to healthy aged subjects have shown that the most specific and sensitive features of AD at this stage are hippocampal and entorhinal cortex atrophy, especially when combined with a reduced volume of the temporal neocortex. MCI patients have significant hippocampal atrophy when compared to aged normal controls. When comparing patients with probable AD to MCI subjects, hippocampal region atrophy significantly extends to the neighboring temporal association neocortex. However, only longitudinal studies of MCI subjects are suited to assess (in a retrospective way) the predictive value of initial atrophy measurements for progression to AD. Few such studies have been published so far and for the most they were based on small samples. Furthermore, the comparison among studies is clouded by differences in both populations studied and MRI methodology used. Nevertheless, comparing the initial MRI data of at-risk subjects who convert to AD at follow-up to those of nonconverters suggests that a reduced association temporal neocortex volume combined with hippocampal or anterior cingulate cortex atrophy may be the best predictor of progression to AD. These data, although still preliminary, are consistent with postmortem studies describing the hierarchical progression of tau lesions in normal aging and early stages of AD, such that damage to the medial temporal lobe and association cortex would account for the memory and nonmemory cognitive impairments, respectively, the combination of which is required to operationally define probable AD. Future research in this field should capitalize on thorough methodology for brain structure delineation, and combine atrophy measurements to cognitive and/or functional imaging data. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

However, the general case of limited training samples, as well as different feature representations typically makes this problem challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple kernel-learning framework to combine multimodal features for AD classification, which is scalable and easy to implement. Contrary to the usual way of solving the problem in the dual, we look at the optimization from a new perspective. By conducting Fourier transform on the Gaussian kernel, we explicitly compute the mapping function, which leads to a more straightforward solution of the problem in the primal. Furthermore, we impose the mixed $L21 norm constraint on the kernel weights, known as the group lasso regularization, to enforce group sparsity among different feature modalities. This actually acts as a role of feature modality selection, while at the same time exploiting complementary information among different kernels. Therefore, it is able to extract the most discriminative features for classification. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.",0.48215675,0.54321796,0.5775363,0.5462872,0.51159084,0.4425661,0.48489532,0.4849195,0.47836006,0.53049,0.4950872,0.47263214,0.49928382,0.5366244,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found
1556,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.03.010,4.73E-05,1,0,"To achieve more accurate and consistent registration in an image population, a novel hierarchical groupwise registration framework, called Atlas Building by Self-Organized Registration and Bundling (ABSORB), is proposed in this paper. In this new framework, the global structure, i.e., the relative distribution of subject images is always preserved during the registration process by constraining each subject image to deform only locally with respect to its neighbors within the learned image manifold. To achieve this goal, two novel strategies, i.e., the self-organized registration by warping one image towards a set of its eligible neighbors and image bundling to cluster similar images, are specially proposed. By using these two strategies, this new framework can perform groupwise registration in a hierarchical way. Specifically, in the high level, it will perform on a much smaller dataset formed by the representative subject images of all subgroups that are generated in the previous levels of registration. Compared to the other groupwise registration methods, our proposed framework has several advantages: (1) it explores the local data distribution and uses the obtained distribution information to guide the registration; (2) the possible registration error can be greatly reduced by requiring each individual subject to move only towards its nearby subjects with similar structures; (3) it can produce a smoother registration path, in general, from each subject image to the final built atlas than other groupwise registration methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed framework can achieve substantial improvements, compared to the other two widely used groupwise registration methods, in terms of both registration accuracy and robustness. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",0.2972266,0.38421935,0.34409395,0.30109778,0.3046268,0.213594,0.24880984,0.23693727,0.266142,0.30999205,0.26558107,0.28878966,0.27881786,0.38538545,ABSORB: Atlas building by self-organized registration and bundling,7/1/2010,,Hongjun Jia; Guorong Wu; Qian Wang; Dinggang Shen,NeuroImage,94,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77952419496&origin=inward,,,,1057-1070,2010,"@article{,

A discriminative learning with multilayer feature hierarchy is designed to further improve performance. Also, hybrid representation is proposed to maximally explore data from multiple modalities. A novel normalization method is devised to tackle the intra- and inter-subject variations from the multimodal data.

Recent advances in statistical learning theory have led to the application of support vector machines to MRI for detection of a variety of disease states. The aims of this study were to assess how successfully support vector machines assigned individual diagnoses and to determine whether data-sets combined from multiple scanners and different centres could be used to obtain effective classification of scans. We used linear support vector machines to classify the grey matter segment of T1-weighted MR scans from pathologically proven AD patients and cognitively normal elderly individuals obtained from two centres with different scanning equipment. Because the clinical diagnosis of mild AD is difficult we also tested the ability of support vector machines to differentiate control scans from patients without post-mortem confirmation. Finally we sought to use these methods to differentiate scans between patients suffering from AD from those with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Up to 96% of pathologically verified AD patients were correctly classified using whole brain images. Data from different centres were successfully combined achieving comparable results from the separate analyses. Importantly, data from one centre could be used to train a support vector machine to accurately differentiate AD and normal ageing scans obtained from another centre with different subjects and different scanner equipment. Patients with mild, clinically probable AD and age/sex matched controls were correctly separated in 89% of cases which is compatible with published diagnosis rates in the best clinical centres. This method correctly assigned 89% of patients with post-mortem confirmed diagnosis of either AD or frontotemporal lobar degeneration to their respective group. Our study leads to three conclusions: Firstly, support vector machines successfully separate patients with AD from healthy aging subjects. Secondly, they perform well in the differential diagnosis of two different forms of dementia. Thirdly, the method is robust and can be generalized across different centres. This suggests an important role for computer based diagnostic image analysis for clinical practice. © 2008 The Author(s).",0.52352655,0.5630197,0.5729817,0.5851957,0.5419295,0.5035713,0.50869405,0.49795964,0.53787076,0.5419044,0.5298221,0.509974,0.5139652,0.61760193,Automatic classification of MR scans in Alzheimer's disease,3/1/2008,,Stefan Klöppel; Cynthia M.

Awareness of memory deficit was assessed with the Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q), identifying two groups: low (MCI/unaware; 17 patients) and good (MCI/aware; 25 patients) aMCI awareness. Twenty-nine age-matched healthy subjects represented the control group. SPM2 was used to assess the correlation between brain metabolism and MAC-Q score, for comparisons between each patient group and controls, and between aMCI/unaware and aMCI/aware groups. The two aMCI groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, education, depression, and neuropsychological tests scores. In the whole 42-patient group, a positive correlation was found between MAC-Q score and metabolism in posterior cingulate cortex in both hemispheres and in inferior parietal lobule, middle cingulate cortex, precuneus and angular gyrus in the left hemisphere. Compared to controls, hypometabolism was found in aMCI/unaware in three large clusters, including precuneus, inferior parietal lobule and superior occipital gyrus, in the left hemisphere, and in inferior parietal lobule, angular gyrus and middle temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere. Smaller clusters of hypometabolism were found in bilateral temporal lobe in aMCI/aware. Hypometabolism in inferior parietal lobule, angular gyrus and superior temporal gyrus in the left hemisphere was highlighted in aMCI/unaware versus aMCI/aware. The significant correlation in all 42 aMCI patients points to posteromedial cortex as a key node of the network being involved in awareness of memory deficit. Patients with low awareness show a more severe hypometabolic pattern, typical of Alzheimer's disease and therefore could be more at risk of developing dementia. © 2010 IOS Press and the authors.

Unfortunately, the nature of high dimension of neural data and few available samples led to the creation of a precise computer diagnostic system. Machine learning techniques, especially deep learning, have been considered as a useful tool in this field. Inspired by the concept of unsupervised feature learning that uses artificial intelligence to learn features from raw data, a two-stage method was presented for an intelligent diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. At the first stage of learning, scattered filtering, an uncontrolled two-layer neural network was used to directly learn features from raw data. At the second stage, SoftMax regression was used to categorize health statuses based on the learned features. The proposed method was validated by the data sets of Alzheimer’s Brain Images. The results showed that the proposed method achieved very good diagnostic accuracy and was better than the existing methods for brain image data sets. The proposed method reduces the need for human work and makes it easy to intelligently diagnose for big data processing, because the learning features are adaptive.

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.",0.38529617,0.39145467,0.38664624,0.4082481,0.5516479,0.39274168,0.474967,0.46916652,0.40204185,0.47192073,0.53589,0.5016393,0.491915,0.4080541,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

However, most of the existing methods utilize data from all source domains, ignoring the fact that unrelated source domains may degrade the learning performance. Also, previous studies assume that class labels for all subjects are reliable, without considering the ambiguity of class labels caused by slight differences between early AD patients and normal control subjects. To address these issues, we propose to transform the original binary class label of a particular subject into a multi-bit label coding vector with the aid of multiple source domains. We further develop a robust multi-label transfer feature learning (rMLTFL) model to simultaneously capture a common set of features from different domains (including the target domain and all source domains) and to identify the unrelated source domains. We evaluate our method on 406 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database with baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data.

We present a large-scale experimental comparison of logistic regression and tree induction, assessing classification accuracy and the quality of rankings based on class-membership probabilities. We use a learning-curve analysis to examine the relationship of these measures to the size of the training set. The results of the study show several things. (1) Contrary to some prior observations, logistic regression does not generally outperform tree induction. (2) More specifically, and not surprisingly, logistic regression is better for smaller training sets and tree induction for larger data sets. Importantly, this often holds for training sets drawn from the same domain (that is, the learning curves cross), so conclusions about induction-algorithm superiority on a given domain must be based on an analysis of the learning curves. (3) Contrary to conventional wisdom, tree induction is effective at producing probability-based rankings, although apparently comparatively less so for a given training-set size than at making classifications. Finally, (4) the domains on which tree induction and logistic regression are ultimately preferable can be characterized surprisingly well by a simple measure of the separability of signal from noise.",0.27897292,0.35715747,0.38631055,0.27673465,0.34035316,0.23003326,0.30768314,0.2859566,0.3647547,0.3126302,0.31062698,0.25988907,0.28594577,0.36725494,Tree induction vs. Logistic regression: A learning-curve analysis,2/15/2004,,Claudia Perlich; Foster Provost; Jeffrey S.

We introduce a new characterization of disease progression, which describes the disease as a series of events, each comprising a significant change in patient state. We provide novel algorithms to learn the event ordering from heterogeneous measurements over a whole patient cohort and demonstrate using combined imaging and clinical data from familial Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease cohorts. Results provide new detail in the progression pattern of these diseases, while confirming known features, and give unique insight into the variability of progression over the cohort. The key advantage of the new model and algorithms over previous progression models is that they do not require a priori division of the patients into clinical stages.

However, multi-modality data are often incomplete because not all data can be collected for every individual. When using such incomplete data for diagnosis, current approaches for addressing the problem of missing data, such as imputation, matrix completion and multi-task learning, implicitly assume linear data-to-label relationship, therefore limiting their performances. We thus propose multi-task deep learning for incomplete data, where prediction tasks that are associated with different modality combinations are learnt jointly to improve the performance of each task.

Semi-supervise learning, which attempts to exploit the unlabeled data in additional to the labeled ones, has attracted much attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised classifier called discriminative deep belief networks (DDBN). DDBN utilizes a new deep architecture to integrate the abstraction ability of deep belief nets (DBN) and discriminative ability of backpropagation strategy. For unsupervised learning, DDBN inherits the advantage of DBN, which preserves the information well from high-dimensional features space to low-dimensional embedding. For supervised learning, through a well designed objective function, the backpropagation strategy directly optimizes the classification results in training dataset by refining the parameter space. Moreover, we apply DDBN to visual data classification task and observe an important fact that the learning ability of deep architecture is seriously underrated in real-world applications, especially in visual data analysis. The comparative experiments on standard datasets of different types and different scales demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms both representative semi-supervised classifiers and existing deep learning techniques. For visual dataset, we can further improve the DDBN performance with much larger and deeper architecture. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we train a 3D CNN to detect Alzheimer’s disease based on structural MRI scans of the brain. Then, we apply four different gradient-based and occlusion-based visualization methods that explain the network’s classification decisions by highlighting relevant areas in the input image. We compare the methods qualitatively and quantitatively. We find that all four methods focus on brain regions known to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease, such as inferior and middle temporal gyrus. While the occlusion-based methods focus more on specific regions, the gradient-based methods pick up distributed relevance patterns. Additionally, we find that the distribution of relevance varies across patients, with some having a stronger focus on the temporal lobe, whereas for others more cortical areas are relevant.

We trained our approaches using T1-weighted brain MRIs from 30 subjects [10 normal elderly, 10 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD)], and tested on an independent set of 40 subjects (20 normal, 20 AD). Manually segmented gold standard hippocampal tracings were available for all subjects (training and testing). We assessed each approach's accuracy relative to manual segmentations, and its power to map AD effects. We then converted the segmentations into parametric surfaces to map disease effects on anatomy. After surface reconstruction, we computed significance maps, and overall corrected $p$-values, for the 3-D profile of shape differences between AD and normal subjects. Our AdaBoost and Ada-SVM segmentations compared favorably with the manual segmentations and detected disease effects as well as FreeSurfer on the data tested.

Such formulation finds applications in many machine learning tasks including multi-task learning, matrix classification, and matrix completion. The standard semidefinite programming formulation for this problem is computationally expensive. In addition, due to the non-smooth nature of the trace norm, the optimal first-order black-box method for solving such class of problems converges as O( 1/k ), where k is the iteration counter. In this paper, we exploit the special structure of the trace norm, based on which we propose an extended gradient algorithm that converges as O( 1/k ). We further propose an accelerated gradient algorithm, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of O( 1/k2 ) for smooth problems. Experiments on multi-task learning problems demonstrate the eficiency of the proposed algorithms.

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods. © 2006 Royal Statistical Society.",0.19973284,0.27891925,0.2930048,0.20354727,0.1921389,0.17418668,0.21571715,0.19570813,0.24017715,0.24226563,0.22513539,0.22906065,0.223393,0.24592192,Model selection and estimation in regression with grouped variables,2/1/2006,,Ming Yuan; Yi Lin,Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

This approach uses spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients to model the shape of the hippocampi, which are segmented from magnetic resonance images (MRI) using a fully automatic method that we previously developed. SPHARM coefficients are used as features in a classification procedure based on support vector machines (SVM). The most relevant features for classification are selected using a bagging strategy. We evaluate the accuracy of our method in a group of 23 patients with AD (10 males, 13 females, age ± standard-deviation (SD) = 73 ± 6 years, mini-mental score (MMS) = 24.4 ± 2.8), 23 patients with amnestic MCI (10 males, 13 females, age ± SD = 74 ± 8 years, MMS = 27.3 ± 1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13 males, 12 females, age ± SD = 64 ± 8 years), using leave-one-out cross-validation. For AD vs controls, we obtain a correct classification rate of 94%, a sensitivity of 96%, and a specificity of 92%. For MCI vs controls, we obtain a classification rate of 83%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 84%. This accuracy is superior to that of hippocampal volumetry and is comparable to recently published SVM-based whole-brain classification methods, which relied on a different strategy. This new method may become a useful tool to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",0.1310246,0.1498386,0.17596616,0.15472461,0.16028655,0.13664424,0.1484663,0.1234294,0.20125633,0.12466309,0.17842746,0.1658068,0.12964246,0.15864173,A second generation human haplotype map of over 3.1 million SNPs,10/18/2007,,Kelly A.

The loss pattern was visualized in four dimensions as it spread over time from temporal and limbic cortices into frontal and occipital brain regions, sparing sensorimotor cortices. The shifting deficits were asymmetric (left hemisphere > right hemisphere) and correlated with progressively declining cognitive status (p < 0.0006). Novel brain mapping methods allowed us to visualize dynamic patterns of atrophy in 52 high-resolution magnetic resonance image scans of 12 patients with AD (age 68.4 ± 1.9 years) and 14 elderly matched controls (age 71.4 ± 0.9 years) scanned longitudinally (two scans; interscan interval 2.1 ± 0.4 years). A cortical pattern matching technique encoded changes in brain shape and tissue distribution across subjects and time. Cortical atrophy occurred in a well defined sequence as the disease progressed, mirroring the sequence of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation observed in cross sections at autopsy. Advancing deficits were visualized as dynamic maps that change over time. Frontal regions, spared early in the disease, showed pervasive deficits later (< 15% loss). The maps distinguished different phases of AD and differentiated AD from normal aging. Local gray matter loss rates (5.3 ± 2.3% per year in AD v 0.9 ± 0.9% per year in controls) were faster in the left hemisphere (p < 0.029) than the right. Transient barriers to disease progression appeared at limbic/frontal boundaries. This degenerative sequence, observed in vivo as it developed, provides the first quantitative, dynamic visualization of cortical atrophic rates in normal elderly populations and in those with dementia.",0.4343376,0.43338606,0.43635827,0.44439086,0.42021784,0.41015914,0.40845042,0.38560173,0.47168422,0.42513496,0.4298028,0.39894617,0.42999104,0.4708214,Dynamics of gray matter loss in Alzheimer's disease,2/1/2003,,Paul M.

The CAD system was developed in four stages. First, we used a voxel-based morphometry technique to investigate global and local gray matter (GM) atrophy in an AD group compared with healthy controls (HCs). Regions with significant GM volume reduction were segmented as volumes of interest (VOIs). Second, these VOIs were used to extract voxel values from the respective atrophy regions in AD, HC, stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) patient groups. The voxel values were then extracted into a feature vector. Third, at the feature-selection stage, all features were ranked according to their respective t-test scores and a genetic algorithm designed to find the optimal feature subset. The Fisher criterion was used as part of the objective function in the genetic algorithm. Finally, the classification was carried out using a support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold cross validation. We evaluated the proposed automatic CAD system by applying it to baseline values from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (160 AD, 162 HC, 65 sMCI and 71 pMCI subjects).

1281,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.42.1.183,5.72E-05,1,0,We evaluated a new magnetic resonance (MR)-based technique for performing volumetric measurements of temporal lobe structures. The technique was designed to assist in making the clinical diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). We chose specific anatomic regions of interest because of their known involvement in memory function and in the neuropathology of DAT and used a regression model to assess the effects of age on the volumes of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and the hippocampal formation (HF). These measurements were normalized by total intracranial volume (TIV). The volumetric measurementsof both the normalized ATL and HF were significantly smaller (p < 0.001) in DAT patients (N = 20) than in controls (N = 22) but the HF volumes provided muchbetter separation between the two groups. Eighty-five percent of the DAT patients fell below the range of the HF/TIV measurement for the control subjects. This separation held up over the entire age range studied. Normalized volumes of both the HF and ATL decreased with age significantly for both the DAT patients and the controls. These results support thecontention that MR-based HF volumetric measurements are accurate in differentiating DAT patients from cognitively normal elderly individuals. This technique may be a useful adjunct in making the clinical diagnosis of DAT. © 1992 American Academy of Neurology.,0.44489738,0.45500028,0.43991137,0.46543896,0.42488036,0.37862402,0.3954285,0.37777534,0.45102087,0.39749825,0.4367278,0.44713405,0.40271991,0.5012384,MR-based hippocampal volumetry in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,1/1/1992,,Clifford R.

Our system's architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex. We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex.,0.33272856,0.35879996,0.35826883,0.3051024,0.35484093,0.26489523,0.2735374,0.2705242,0.32238078,0.4007529,0.3534016,0.333216,0.3600243,0.39995536,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [O iii] λ5007 Å, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to ∼1000 Å. We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some active galactic nuclei interlopers including eight newly discovered narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low-mass galaxies (M ∼ 108.5-1010 M⊙) with high star formation rates (∼10 M⊙ yr-1), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 ∼ 8.7) and low reddening [E(B - V) ≤ 0.25] and they reside in low-density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to ∼10-8 yr-1) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myr. The few star-forming Peas with Hubble Space Telescope imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to luminous blue compact galaxies. They are also similar to high-redshift ultraviolet-luminous galaxies, e.g. Lyman-break galaxies and Lyα emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe. © 2009 RAS.",0.06580788,0.11885092,0.09125758,0.10736531,0.12337878,0.07240231,0.106301785,0.09858168,0.14473349,0.1312819,0.14680624,0.13599974,0.118624076,0.13226658,Galaxy Zoo Green Peas: Discovery of a class of compact extremely star-forming galaxies,1/1/2009,,Carolin Cardamone; Kevin Schawinski; Marc Sarzi; Steven P.

Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were derived for the three orthogonal axes and an index of diffusion anisotropy (IDA=ADC(max-min)/ADC(mean)) was then calculated. Although no significant differences were found in ADC and IDA values in the hippocampal body between controls and patients, vertical (superior-inferior) ADC values and ADC(mean) values in the temporal stem of patients with AD were significantly higher than those in controls, and IDA values were therefore significantly lower in patients with possible or probable AD than those in controls. Moreover, IDA values in the temporal stem were significantly correlated with the clinical severity.

The impact of these characteristics on the performance was evaluated using a multivariate mixed effect linear regressions. We found that using cognitive, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography or potentially electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography variables significantly improved predictive performance compared to not including them, whereas including other modalities, in particular T1 magnetic resonance imaging, did not show a significant effect. The good performance of cognitive assessments questions the wide use of imaging for predicting the progression to AD and advocates for exploring further fine domain-specific cognitive assessments.

A 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was developed for the classification task.

We develop algorithms for data encoding and codebook learning, and show in experiments that the method leads to more invariant and discriminative image representations.

The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of statistic that enter into the gradient of the log likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer pretraining phase that initializes the weights sensibly. The pretraining also allows the variational inference to be initialized sensibly with a single bottom-up pass.We present results on the MNIST and NORB data sets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn very good generative models of handwritten digits and 3D objects.

We address the following problems inherent to supervised learning models: 1) the need of a large set of training images; 2) robustness to imaging conditions not present in the training data; and 3) complex search process. The innovations of our approach reside in a formulation that decouples the rigid and nonrigid detections, deep learning methods that model the appearance of the LV, and efficient derivative-based search algorithms. The functionality of our approach is evaluated using a data set of diseased cases containing 400 annotated images (from 12 sequences) and another data set of normal cases comprising 80 annotated images (from two sequences), where both sets present long axis views of the LV. Using several error measures to compute the degree of similarity between the manual and automatic segmentations, we show that our method not only has high sensitivity and specificity but also presents variations with respect to a gold standard (computed from the manual annotations of two experts) within interuser variability on a subset of the diseased cases. We also compare the segmentations produced by our approach and by two state-of-the-art LV segmentation models on the data set of normal cases, and the results show that our approach produces segmentations that are comparable to these two approaches using only 20 training images and increasing the training set to 400 images causes our approach to be generally more accurate. Finally, we show that efficient search methods reduce up to tenfold the complexity of the method while still producing competitive segmentations.

By considering only the intensity levels inside the Gaussians, the resulting feature space has a significantly reduced dimensionality with respect to former approaches using the voxel intensities directly as features (VAF).

Training is composed of three processes: training the first classifier, determining the LCOI of the first classifier, and training the second classifier upon the data items whose output fall in the LCOI. The LCOI is determined varying a threshold on the false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR) curves. We have tested the approach on a database of feature vectors for the classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control subjects extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data.

Over 24,000 volunteers reviewed the Kepler Quarter 1 data set. We examine the abundance of ≥2 R ⊕ planets on short-period (<15days) orbits based on Planet Hunters detections. We present these results along with an analysis of the detection efficiency of human classifiers to identify planetary transits including a comparison to the Kepler inventory of planet candidates. Although performance drops rapidly for smaller radii, ≥4 R ⊕ Planet Hunters ≥85% efficient at identifying transit signals for planets with periods less than 15days for the Kepler sample of target stars.

An iterative method of solving logistic regression with fused lasso regularization is proposed to make this a practical procedure. In this study we analyzed callosal thickness profiles sampled at 100 equal intervals between the rostrum and the splenium. The method was applied to corpora callosa of elderly normal controls (NCs) and patients with very mild or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database.

Different resolutions are represented using a coarse-to-fine feature hierarchy. During detection, the lower resolution features are initially used to reject the majority of negative windows at relatively low cost, leaving a relatively small number of windows to be processed in higher resolutions. This enables the use of computationally more expensive higher resolution features to achieve high detection accuracy. We applied this framework on Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features for object detection. Our multi-resolution detector produced better performance for pedestrian detection than state-of-the-art methods [7], and was faster during both training and testing.

The highest accuracy was obtained by random splitting across the whole population. The accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) in the candidate population obtained by LASSO-LARS was 089 with 156 explanatory SNPs. This value was higher than those obtained by Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) and a Bayesian method (BayesA), which were 0.75 and 0.84, respectively. In the mouse data, 1600 individuals were randomly allocated to the reference population. The GEBVs for the remaining 285 individuals estimated by LASSO-LARS were more accurate than those obtained by BLUP and BayesA for weight at six weeks and slightly lower for growth rate and body length. It was concluded that LASSO-LARS approach is a good alternative method to estimate marker effects for genomic selection, particularly when the cost of genotyping can be reduced by using a limited subset of markers. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",0.21089847,0.3020155,0.29331353,0.22665696,0.2436601,0.18316926,0.26903847,0.24882875,0.25873914,0.25718108,0.24422182,0.225509,0.23753679,0.29818168,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

Three groups of age, education, and gender matched NL, MCI, and AD subjects were studied. The results supported the hypotheses: 1) entorhinal cortex MRglu and hippocampal volume were most accurate in classifying NL and MCI; 2) both imaging modalities identified the temporal neocortex as best separating MCI and AD, whereas widespread changes accurately classified NL and AD; 3) In most between group comparisons regional MRglu measures were diagnostically superior to volume measures. These cross-sectional data show that in MCI hippocampal formation changes exist without significant neocortical changes. Neocortical changes best characterize AD. In both MCI and AD, metabolism reductions exceed volume losses. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",0.48871508,0.48427576,0.5039899,0.58498764,0.45747223,0.3925805,0.4339954,0.4247096,0.5104783,0.479636,0.46662757,0.46113774,0.48289034,0.550684,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found,Not found

On the other hand, with the nature of being prevalent, inexpensive and non-invasive, CT does present diagnostic features of AD to a great extent. This study explores the significance and impact on the application of the burgeoning deep learning techniques to the task of classification of CT brain images, in particular utilising convolutional neural network (CNN), aiming at providing supplementary information for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Towards this end, three categories of CT images (N = 285) are clustered into three groups, which are AD, lesion (e.g. tumour) and normal ageing. In addition, considering the characteristics of this collection with larger thickness along the direction of depth (z) (~3–5 mm), an advanced CNN architecture is established integrating both 2D and 3D CNN networks. The fusion of the two CNN networks is subsequently coordinated based on the average of Softmax scores obtained from both networks consolidating 2D images along spatial axial directions and 3D segmented blocks respectively. As a result, the classification accuracy rates rendered by this elaborated CNN architecture are 85.2%, 80% and 95.3% for classes of AD, lesion and normal respectively with an average of 87.6%. Additionally, this improved CNN network appears to outperform the others when in comparison with 2D version only of CNN network as well as a number of state of the art hand-crafted approaches. As a result, these approaches deliver accuracy rates in percentage of 86.3, 85.6 ± 1.10, 86.3 ± 1.04, 85.2 ± 1.60, 83.1 ± 0.35 for 2D CNN, 2D SIFT, 2D KAZE, 3D SIFT and 3D KAZE respectively.

The present pattern recognition study addressed this by using neuropsychological test scores and neuroimaging morphological measures to predict the later development of mild cognitive impairment in cognitively normal community-dwelling individuals aged 70-90. years. A feature selection algorithm chose a subset of neuropsychological and FreeSurfer-derived morphometric features that optimally differentiated between individuals who developed mild cognitive impairment and individuals who remained cognitively normal. Support vector machines were used to train classifiers and test prediction performance, which was evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation to reduce variability. Prediction performance was greater when using a combination of neuropsychological scores and morphological measures than when using either of these alone. Results for the combined method were: accuracy 78.51%, sensitivity 73.33%, specificity 79.75%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.841. Of all the features investigated, memory performance and measures of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe were the most discriminative. Our prediction method offers the potential to detect elderly individuals with apparently normal cognition at risk of imminent cognitive decline.

Brain disorder data poses many unique challenges for data mining research. For example, the raw data generated by neuroimaging experiments is in tensor representations, with typical characteristics of high dimensionality, structural complexity, and nonlinear separability. Furthermore, brain connectivity networks can be constructed from the tensor data, embedding subtle interactions between brain regions. Other clinical measures are usually available reflecting the disease status from different perspectives. It is expected that integrating complementary information in the tensor data and the brain network data, and incorporating other clinical parameters will be potentially transformative for investigating disease mechanisms and for informing therapeutic interventions. Many research efforts have been devoted to this area. They have achieved great success in various applications, such as tensor-based modeling, subgraph pattern mining, and multi-view feature analysis.

In practice, multimodal images may be incomplete since PET is often missing due to high financial costs or availability. Most of the existing methods simply excluded subjects with missing data, which unfortunately reduced the sample size. In addition, how to extract and combine multimodal features is still challenging. To address these problems, we propose a deep learning framework to integrate a task-induced pyramid and attention generative adversarial network (TPA-GAN) with a pathwise transfer dense convolution network (PT-DCN) for imputation and classification of multimodal brain images. First, we propose a TPA-GAN to integrate pyramid convolution and attention module as well as disease classification task into GAN for generating the missing PET data with their MRI. Then, with the imputed multimodal images, we build a dense convolution network with pathwise transfer blocks to gradually learn and combine multimodal features for final disease classification.

The principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a lightweight deep-learning network that mainly uses principal component analysis (PCA) to generate multilevel filter banks for the centralized learning of samples and then performs binarization and generates blockwise histograms to obtain image features. However, the dimensions of the extracted PCANet features reaching tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands, and the formation of the multilevel filter banks is sample data dependent, reducing the flexibility of PCANet. In order to solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a data-independent network based on the idea of PCANet, called the nonnegative matrix factorization tensor decomposition network (NMF-TDNet). Specifically, we use nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) instead of PCA to create multilevel filter banks for sample learning, then uses the learning results to build a higher-order tensor and perform tensor decomposition (TD) to achieve data dimensionality reduction, producing the final image features. Finally, our method use these features as the input of the support vector machine (SVM) for AD classification diagnosis and clinical score prediction.

By now, large amounts of data from multi-site studies have been made available for developing, training, and evaluating automated classifiers. Yet, their translation to the clinic remains challenging, in part due to their limited generalizability across different datasets. In this work, we describe a compact classification approach that mitigates overfitting by regularizing the multinomial regression with the mixed ℓ1/ℓ2 norm. We combine volume, thickness, and anatomical shape features from MRI scans to characterize neuroanatomy for the three-class classification of Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. We demonstrate high classification accuracy via independent evaluation within the scope of the CADDementia challenge. We, furthermore, demonstrate that variations between source and target datasets can substantially influence classification accuracy. The main contribution of this work addresses this problem by proposing an approach for supervised domain adaptation based on instance weighting. Integration of this method into our classifier allows us to assess different strategies for domain adaptation. Our results demonstrate (i) that training on only the target training set yields better results than the naïve combination (union) of source and target training sets, and (ii) that domain adaptation with instance weighting yields the best classification results, especially if only a small training component of the target dataset is available.

New measures are needed to improve the diagnosis of individuals with cognitive impairment due to various etiologies.

We demonstrate a range of models capable of accepting flexible combinations of routinely collected clinical information, including demographics, medical history, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and functional assessments. We then show that these frameworks compare favorably with the diagnostic accuracy of practicing neurologists and neuroradiologists. Lastly, we apply interpretability methods in computer vision to show that disease-specific patterns detected by our models track distinct patterns of degenerative changes throughout the brain and correspond closely with the presence of neuropathological lesions on autopsy. Our work demonstrates methodologies for validating computational predictions with established standards of medical diagnosis.",0.53322345,0.5429233,0.56140274,0.58169293,0.5625407,0.6328782,0.5085787,0.5034701,0.5346885,0.5746978,0.60518616,0.54036915,0.59378165,0.5886837,Multimodal deep learning for Alzheimer’s disease dementia assessment,12/1/2022,,Shangran Qiu; Matthew I.
